  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a short collection of notes I&#8217;ve put together on how you can be identified via your mobile phone. If you want to securely use a mobile phone, you&#8217;ll need to use a burner. This is non-trivial. <a href="http://b3rn3d.herokuapp.com/blog/2014/01/22/burner-phone-best-practices/">Here&#8217;s a good guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Clandestine Mobile Phone Use</h2>

<p>Mobile phones should primarily be used for signalling, rather than for actually communicating operational information. Remember the golden rule of telephone conversations:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep it short</li>
<li>keep it simple</li>
<li>stick to your cover</li>
</ul>


<h2>Identifiers</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>

<ul>
<li>Specific location (home, place of work, etc.)</li>
<li>mobility pattern (from home, via commuter route, to work) &#8211; very unique, 4 loc&#8217;s will identify 90%</li>
<li>shared mobility pattern with a known device</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong>

<ul>
<li>numbers dialed</li>
<li>calls received</li>
<li>calling pattern (numbers dialed, for how long, how frequently)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Physical</strong>

<ul>
<li>IMEI (mobile phone device ID)</li>
<li>IMSI (mobile phone telco subscriber ID)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong>

<ul>
<li>Identifiers, e.g. names, locations</li>
<li>Voice fingerprinting</li>
<li>Keywords</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mitigations</h2>

<h3>Turn it OFF, for real.</h3>

<p>Know how to turn the phone to a completely off state. This means removing the battery, taking out the SIM card and placing in a shielded bag (if possible). This <strong>really off</strong> state is how you store and transport the phone when not in use.</p>

<p>A note on storage: it should not be at your house or anywhere that is directly linked to you.</p>

<h3>Take a hike, buster</h3>

<p>Where you use the phone is itself very important. Never use it at locations which are associated with you, that means never at home, never at the office/work, never at a friend&#8217;s house. Never have the phone in an <strong>ON</strong> state at locations that are associated with you, or your immediate social network. Never.</p>

<p>Do not turn the phone in the same location as a phone associated with you. Make sure that your real phone is somewhere else, but not in an <strong>OFF</strong> state if possible. You don&#8217;t want the disappearance of one phone from the network to coincide with the appearance of another. Paired events are indicators of relation, and you want to avoid those as much as possible. You also want you regular phone to appear with a typical usage pattern, which means keeping it on as you normally would.</p>

<h3>Contamination, avoid it</h3>

<p>Never use different phones from the same location.</p>

<p>Never carry phones for different compartments together (keep them turned off, batteries out)</p>

<p>Never carry phones turned on over the same routes you normally take. Avoid patterns and predictability.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>What is a Secure Communication?</h2>

<p>The goals of secure communications are the following. Some of these are surprisingly difficult to achieve:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make the <strong>content</strong> of a message <strong>unreadable</strong> to parties other than the intended one(s)</li>
<li>Make the <strong>meaning</strong> of a message <strong>inaccessible</strong> to parties other than the intended one(s)</li>
<li>Avoid <strong>traffic analysis</strong> — don’t let other parties know that a connection exists between the communicating parties</li>
<li>Avoid <strong>knowledge of the communication</strong> — don’t let other parties know the communication channel or pathway exists</li>
</ol>


<p>The first and second objectives can be accomplished using some combination of <strong>cryptography</strong> and <strong>coding</strong>. Unfortunately, this is the easy part. The more
complicated and difficult component of a secure communications infrastructure is
achieving the third and fourth objectives. For now, however, I will focus only
on the first two issues: protecting content, and meaning.</p>

<p>First lets define our terms so we can discuss the subject with clarity:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cryptography</strong> systems that use transformation processes to turn <em>signal into noise</em>, by obscuring the symbols used for communication</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong> systems that substitute or alter meaning, and thus hide the real message</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Eagle Has Landed</h2>

<p>Codes are extremely useful mechanisms for sending small messages, although as they are <em>plain text</em> their hidden mean can be revealed once the <em>key</em> is cracked. Another issue with codes is that they are inflexible, compared to a cipher system. Coding requires pre-arranged mappings of meanings (what symbols or words translate to what), or at least pre-arranged mechanisms to derive the mappings (e.g., book codes).</p>

<p>To be effective, a code must maintain <strong>proper grammar</strong>, be <strong>consistent</strong>, and fit a <strong>plausible</strong> pretext. If it fits these requirements, and is used appropriately (briefly, consistently, with <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100616_watching_watchers"><em>cover for action</em></a>) then a code system is an excellent choice for simple signalling purposes.</p>

<h3>Doing It Right</h3>

<p>During World War II the BBC cooperated with the intelligence services to send
open code signals to operatives in the occupied territories. These signals were
prearranged with the operatives, and then sent out at two scheduled times. This
signalling channel was used exclusively for indicating whether an operation was
going to take place.</p>

<p>The BBC would broadcast the signal for the first time at 1930, and then confirm
the signal at 2115. If the operation had been canceled before the second scheduled
signal window, the code phrase would not be repeated.</p>

<p>During the early phase of the war, the code system was slightly more complex.
There would be a positive code, and a negative code, for example: &#8220;Jeanne sends
her greetings&#8221; might be a &#8220;go code&#8221;, and &#8220;Jeanne says hello&#8221; might be the &#8220;abort
code&#8221;. Later this was simplified to just the positive code (a tradition that,
apparently, the CIA still follows).</p>

<h3>Doing It Wrong</h3>

<p>There are problems when codes are used inconsistently. For example, some <a href="http://www.wmob.com/cast.html">mafia codes</a> used oblique references to the boss as &#8220;aunt&#8221;, or &#8220;Aunt Julia&#8221;. This was very ineffective when the mafioso suffered pronoun slippage and called their &#8220;aunt&#8221; &#8220;he&#8221;.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Ah, Aunt Julia said he wanted to help me out, too.&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<h2>Codes Gone Wild</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve collected some examples of <a href="http://grugq.tumblr.com/post/60890158036/al-qaedas-codes">real al Qaida codes</a> that were used actively used
prior to the 9/11 attacks. Other types of basic open code are &#8220;business code&#8221;,
which is also used by some criminal groups, where the actors are refered to as
business interests or rivals, and criminal activities are described as &#8220;projects&#8221;
or other innocuous business terms.</p>

<p>A simple code that was used by two KGB operatives was the phrase &#8220;I think we
should go fishing now&#8221;, which indicated that they should discuss business.</p>

<h3>KGB Says What?</h3>

<p>During the early stages of the KGB handling of their FBI penetration Hanssen,
they had a mishap with locating and loading the deaddrop for his payment. To
correct this error, they had to contact Hanssen by phone and use a code that was
not pre-arranged (there was no contingency in place for &#8220;what happens if we cant
find the dead drop&#8221;). The dead drop location was underneath a footbridge and the
KGB operative had placed his load underneath the wrong corner.</p>

<p>Since they had used a pretext of purchasing a used car for
their initial contact, the KGB continued to use that pretext for their &#8220;oops!&#8221;
communique. The KGB operative prepared his telephone conversation
thoroughly before hand so that it would sound natural and plausible:</p>

<blockquote><p>KGB: The car is still available for you as we have agreed last time, I prepared
all the papers and left them on the same table. You didn&#8217;t find them because I
put them in another corner of the table.</p>

<p>Hanssen: I see</p>

<p>KGB: You shouldn&#8217;t worry, everything is okay. The papers are with me now.</p>

<p>Hanssen: Good</p>

<p>KGB: I believe under these circumstances, its not necessary to make any changes
concerning the place and time. Our company is reliable, and we are ready to
give you a substantial discount which will be enclosed in the papers. Now,
about the date of our meeting. I suggest that our meeting will take place
without delay on Febuary 13, one, three, 1:00 PM. Okay? Feburary 13</p>

<p>Hanssen: &#8230;. Okay.</p></blockquote>

<p>The conversations is clearly stilted and strange, but no so strange as to draw
attention to itself. It also doesn&#8217;t reveal anything of the <strong>meaning</strong> that is
being relayed.</p>

<h3>Signaling Codes</h3>

<p>When creating a signaling code, it is important that the pretext for the signal
be broad and widely applicable. Generally it is better that the code be a
specific subject, rather than a specific phrase. Phrases are easy to mixup,
forget, or otherwise confuse. They are also more rigid and hard to work into
a conversation. A subject, on the other hand, is very easy to raise and discuss
in a plausible fashion without seeming forced or unnatural.</p>

<p>A final short code example. This is a signaling code, adapted from a novel,
however it accurately conveys how simple these codes can be. This is phone call
between two colleagues, where <em>Alice</em> has to signal an emergency has occured:</p>

<blockquote><p>Alice: Hi, sorry to call so late</p>

<p>Bob: No problem</p>

<p>Alice: Is our meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 8:30, or at 9?</p>

<p>Bob: It is 8:30, bright and early.</p>

<p>Alice: Ok, right. Just checking. Thanks, bye</p></blockquote>

<h2>Open Codes Fail Open</h2>

<p>When using a code to refer to a classified subject, even though unclassified terms
are used, the subject is still classified. This is a breach of security. See
the US Army <a href="http://www.ncms-isp.org/documents/COMSEC_Material.pdf">handbook on COMSEC</a>
section dealing with <em>ATTEMPTS TO DISGUISE INFORMATION</em> (Section 8.4).</p>

<blockquote><p>“Talking around” is a
technique in which you try to get the information across to the recipient in a
manner you believe will protect it. However, no matter how much you try to
change words about a classified or sensitive subject, it is still classified or
sensitive.</p>

<p>self-made reference system. This is an
attempt to encipher your conversation by using your own system. This system
rarely works because few people are clever enough to refer to an item of
information without actually revealing names, subjects, or other pertinent
information that would reveal the classified or sensitive meaning</p></blockquote>

<p>These are concerns to keep in mind when developing a code system for discussing
sensitive information.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Codes: keep them generic, keep them consistent, limit their use to simple signalling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Of Bomb Threats and Tor</h2>

<p>Recently (December 16th, 2013) there was a <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/16/unconfirmed-reports-explosives-four-buildings/">bomb threat at Harvard University</a>, during finals week. The threat was a hoax, and the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/17/student-charged-bomb-threat/">FBI got their man</a> that very night. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzt0K7_O4qyqUlEtd2pUWE42amM/edit?usp=sharing">affidavit is here</a>.</p>

<p>This post will look at the tools and techniques the operative used to attempt
to hide his actions, why he failed, and what he should&#8217;ve done to improve his
OPSEC. As a hint: I provided an outline of what he should&#8217;ve done 6 months
ago in <a href="http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/06/13/ignorance-is-strength/">&#8220;<strong>ignorance is strength</strong>&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This post is to outline why OPSEC is so difficult to get right,
even for people who go to Harvard. I am not encouraging any illegal behavior,
but instead analyzing how OPSEC precautions can be so difficult to get right.
Don&#8217;t send bomb threats.</p>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

<ol>
<li>The phases of an operation</li>
<li>Counterintelligence (&#8220;know your enemy&#8221;) as a factor in operational design</li>
<li>Avoid reducing the set of suspects

<ul>
<li>If all students are suspects, all one needs to do is avoid narrowing the pool of potential suspects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h2>Strategic Objectives: Avoid Final Exam</h2>

<p>Strategically, the principal behind this operation (Eldo Kim) was attempting to avoid taking
a Final Exam scheduled for the morning of December 16th. To accomplish his objectives
he designed an operation that would cause an evacuation of the building where he
was to take his final. Rather than recruit an agent
and delegate the execution of the operation, the principal decided to do it himself.</p>

<p>This was not an enlightened decision.</p>

<h2>The Structure of All Things (for values of Things = &#8220;Operations&#8221;)</h2>

<p>All offensive operations share a similar core structure. This structure has been
known for a long time in the military, but is rarely applied in other fields.
Operations have distinct phases that they move through as they progress from vague
idea, to concrete plan, through execution and, finally, onto the escape.</p>

<p>The outline framework for an operation, all of the phases, is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Target Selection</li>
<li>Planning (and Surveillance)</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
<li>Execution</li>
<li>Escape and Evasion</li>
</ol>


<p>This framework is frequently used when dissecting a terrorist attack post mortem,
allowing the security forces to identify the agents involved in each phase. Ideally,
the security forces want to remove the people involved in the <em>Target Selection</em>
and <em>Planning</em> stages. These people tend to be the principals, and are more
valuable than the agents who actually perpetrate the attack.</p>

<p>For hacker groups, the operational phases are rarely acknowledged, and followed
in an ad hoc manner. Primarily because few hackers are aware of them. It would be
beneficial for hackers to understand the structure of preparing an operation
thoroughly, but that is an issue we&#8217;ll address another day.</p>

<p>As an aside, it is worth noting that these operational phases apply to a
consultancy making a sale, providing a service, dropping a deliverable, and then
vanishing. ;)</p>

<h2>College Kids are Inexperienced, News at 11.</h2>

<p>All real criminals know that the most important part of an operation is the
get away, the <em>git</em> (as it used to be called). Of course, real criminals don&#8217;t
go to Harvard University (although there&#8217;s an argument to be made that some
graduate from there), and so poor Eldo Kim had no one to teach him the criticality
of the final stage of an operation: <strong>Escape and Evasion</strong>.</p>

<h2>Operation &#8220;Doomed to Failure&#8221;</h2>

<p>The operative used an ad hoc approach to his operational design, and as a result
he made a fatal error. Here is his operational plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Obtain Tor Browser Bundle</li>
<li>Select target email addresses &#8220;randomly&#8221; [see para 11]</li>
<li>Compose email</li>
<li>For each target email address

<ul>
<li>Create new GuerillaMail &#8220;account&#8221;</li>
<li>Send email (<a href="https://www.guerrillamail.com/compose">using this</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>For security, the operative chose to rely on a pseudonymous email tool and the
Tor anonymity network. He used the Tor Browser Bundle on OSX rather
than the TAILS distribution (see: para 11). Provided he closed the tab between
each session, there should be no forensic evidence left on the laptop.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When using <strong>Tor Browser Bundle</strong> close all the tabs and exit the
application when you are done. The TBB will clean up thoroughly after itself,
<em>but only on exit</em>! When you are done, shut it down. Runa&#8217;s <a href="https://research.torproject.org/techreports/tbb-forensic-analysis-2013-06-28.pdf">paper</a> explores this in
detail.</p>

<h3>Phase 1: Target Selection</h3>

<p>The strategic target was the hall hosting the final exam. Tactically, the
principal selected &#8220;email addresses at random&#8221; to receive a bomb threat intended
to force an evacuation of the hall, along with a number of other cover locations.</p>

<h3>Phase 2: Planning</h3>

<p>This step appears to have been focused solely on the technical requirements of
masking the origination of the threatening emails. However, insufficient resources
were devoted to this phase, and therefore it was fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>Here is the email he sent:</p>

<pre><code>shrapnel bombs placed in: 

science center 
sever hall 
emerson hall 
thayer hall 

2/4. guess correctly. 

be quick for they will go off soon
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly he intended to provide cover locations, and he attempted to prolong the
bomb search by suggesting that some locations where legitimately bomb free. It
is standard operating procedure for bomb threats to be investigated thoroughly
and in parallel.</p>

<h3>Phase 3: Deployment</h3>

<p>The operative chose to use GuerrillaMail to send the emails, and because
GuerrillaMail reveals the source IP of the sender, he also chose Tor to mask his
IP address. However, he used a monitored network to access Tor, which severely
limits the anonymity provided by Tor. This error was to prove fatal.</p>

<h3>Phase 4: Execution</h3>

<p>Kim used the Harvard University wifi network. To gain access, he had to login
with his username and password. The university monitors and logs all network
activity. This was the fatal error. He authenticated to the network, his IP was
used to access Tor, and this information was logged.</p>

<p>When the incident was investigated the FBI was able to pull the logs and determine
not just whether anyone had accessed Tor, but exactly <strong>who</strong> had accessed Tor.</p>

<h3>Phase 5: Escape and Evasion</h3>

<p>There was nothing at all done for this phase. It is worth noting that there is
little he could have done to prepare for an interview by seasoned professional
FBI interrogators. As an amateur, he stood approximately zero chance of surviving.</p>

<h2>Counterintelligence: Know your Adversary</h2>

<p>A study of the investigation methods used by the law enforcement officials
engaged to investigate bomb threats would have been beneficial for Mr Kim. He
would have realized that they would target the likely suspects, attempt to
narrow the suspect pool down to the minimum set, then start interviewing. The
more strongly the evidence points to a set of suspects, the more aggressive the
interviews will be. From &#8220;do you know anything about&#8230;&#8221; to &#8220;We have all the
evidence we need, why don&#8217;t you make it easy for yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Initially the suspects for the case would have been any student scheduled to
take an exam
at one of the targeted halls. This is doubtless a large number, and without any
specific information to go on, the chance of interviewing all of them is slim.
If, however, the FBI did interview all of them, the questioning would be general
and undirected, rather than specific and probing. An amateur, like Kim, who kept
his cool and simply denied any knowledge of the hoax would have had a reasonable
chance of evading suspicion.</p>

<p>Knowing the investigative techniques of his adversary would have allowed Kim to
design an operation that provided for a reliable escape and evasion phase. He
would have used an unmonitored network, in an unmonitored location near by the
school, to send his threats. This would have left the suspect pool extremely
large &#8211; &#8220;everyone&#8221;.</p>

<p>When planning an operation, know how the adversary will respond. This will allow
you to factor that response into your planning. If you do not know how your
adversary will respond, then their response will be a surprise. Do not allow
the reactive force to surprise you.</p>

<h2>There is no OPSEC magic sauce</h2>

<p>The content and context of the threat make it clear
that the originator of the emails was a student (or possibly a professor/TA trying
to avoid grading exams). The important thing to hide is <strong>which</strong> student, not
that it was a student. Therefore simply using a nearby cafe with free wifi should
have been sufficient to mask the specific identity of the operative. Assuming:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are cafes that do not know the operative by sight,</li>
<li>there are cafes that are not monitored by CCTV (wear a hat, don&#8217;t look up),</li>
<li>that he wore a simple disguise to reduce the recall of the witnesses (look generic), and</li>
<li>that a college kid in a cafe at 8am during Finals week is not unusual</li>
</ul>


<p>Using Tor from the college campus was a fatal error. The pool of suspects was
immediately reduced to &#8220;everyone that used Tor during the time the bomb threats
were sent&#8221;. Since Silk Road v1 has been shut down, that is obviously going to be
a small number.</p>

<h2>Lets call it half a win</h2>

<p>Strategically, the operation was successful. Eldo Kim will not have to take his
final exam. Or, indeed, other final exams he might not be prepared for. However,
it is hard to imagine this is the outcome he was hoping for.</p>

<p>A few years ago a group of child pornographers was infiltrated by police who were
able to monitor, interact, and aggressively investigate the members. Despite
engaging in a 15 month undercover operation, only one in three of the pedophiles
were successfully apprehended. The majority, including the now infamous leader
<em>Yardbird</em>, escaped capture. The dismal success rate of the law enforcement
officials was due entirely to the strict security rules followed by the group.</p>

<p>This post will examine those rules, the reasons for their success, and the
problems the group faced which necessitated those rules.</p>

<p>(An examination of the group&#8217;s security from a slightly different perspective
was conducted by <code>Baal</code> and is available <a href="http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html">here</a>)</p>

<h2>Covert Organizations, Seen One, Seen &#8216;em All</h2>

<p>All covert organizations face a similar set of problems as they attempt to execute
on their fundamental mission &#8211; to <strong>continue to exist</strong>. A covert organization
in an adversarial environment faces a number of organizational challenges and
constraints. Fundamentally how it handles trade-offs between operational
security and efficiency mandates how group members perform their operational
activities. Strong OPSEC means low efficiency, while high efficiency necessitates
weak OPSEC. The strength of the oppositional forces dictate the minimum security
requirements of the covert organization.</p>

<p>Examining the operational activities &#8211; those actions the organization must engage
in to self perpetuate &#8211; allows us to evaluate their operational security decisions
within their environmental context.</p>

<h3>Operational Activities:</h3>

<p>The <em>Yardbird</em> child abuse content group (hereafter also called the <em>enterprise</em>)
had a number of core goals that had to be addressed to continue operation: they
needed to distribute their child abuse content to members; communicate between
members; raise funds to acquire new content; recruit new members (presumably for
access to additional child abuse content).</p>

<p>Explicitly stated, this is an enumerated list of the operational activities that
the group <strong>had</strong> to engage in to self perpetuate.</p>

<ol>
<li>Distribution of Child Abuse Content</li>
<li>Communication and Coordinate Action</li>
<li>Fund raising</li>
<li>Recruitment and Vetting</li>
</ol>


<p>Except for the first issue (strategically significant only to this group),
these are pretty typical activities for a clandestine organization. Besides their
defining operational activity, they need a communications channel, fund raising
capability, and membership management processes.</p>

<h2>Opposition Success: The Penetration</h2>

<p>The law enforcement authorities caught a pedophile distribution child abuse
content. He is a member of the <em>Yardbird</em> group and offers up complete access
to the group, along with archival logs, in exchange for leniency.</p>

<p>All of the information about this group comes from the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzt0K7_O4qyqMi0ycjZFdzhxYTA/edit?usp=sharing">Castleman Affidavit</a>,
the <code>Baal</code> <a href="http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html">analysis</a>, and some <code>Baal</code> <a href="http://alt.privacy.anon-server.narkive.com/VRl3dTFH/the-fourth-of-yardbird-s-chums-grabs-his-ankles">follow ups</a>.</p>

<h2>A Frustrating Infiltration</h2>

<p>The law enforcement authorities were about to completely penetrate the <em>enterprise</em>
for a 15 month period from 2006-08-31 through 2007-12-15. During that time the
group&#8217;s posted 400,000 images and 1,1000 videos. The <em>enterprise</em> had approximately
45 active members, although <a href="http://alt.privacy.anon-server.narkive.com/VRl3dTFH/the-fourth-of-yardbird-s-chums-grabs-his-ankles">independent observers</a> have claimed this is low with
the real membership anywhere from 48 to 61.</p>

<p>The total number of arrests was 14, or somewhere around 1/3rd. A fully staffed,
highly motivated, well trained adversarial force with complete penetration of
a large complacent group was only about to achieve a one in three success rate.
The majority of those successes were achieved due to group members being insufficiently
cautious and violating the <em>enterprise</em> security rules. Obviously, these security
rules are extremely resilient against adversarial assault.</p>

<p>The members who were caught were those who violated the security SOP of the group:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accessing a newsgroup server without using Tor (e.g. VPN, or directly)</li>
<li>Revealing personal details about themselves</li>
<li>Contacting each other outside the group&#8217;s secure comms channel</li>
</ul>


<h2>Operational Activity: Distribution</h2>

<p>The <em>enterprise</em> was careful to ensure that the location of the encrypted files
containing child abuse images was a different newsgroup from the communications
newsgroup. One possible reason is to unlink the obvious encrypted group discussion
from the larger encrypted content posts. That is, they compartmented their
commo from their file sharing. As an additional, although superfluous step, the
<em>enterprise</em> would apparently alter the sequence number of the split binary
uploads so that reassembly would be hampered. What this cumbersome step added
beyond the existing PGP encryption is unclear (if your adversary can break PGP
they can probably figure out the order some files).</p>

<h2>Operational Activity: Communications</h2>

<p>The <em>enterprise</em> would use the primary newsgroup, at the start of the investigation
<code>alt.anonymous.messages</code>, to announce the location of a media cache for group
members. The communications newsgroup is always reserved strictly for communications.
The announcements regarding new downloads provided detailed instructions as to
the location of the child abuse content, plus how to download, assemble and decrypt it.</p>

<p>The group used a single shared PGP key for all members. On the one hand, this
would completely negate the security provided by PGP if the key falls into the
wrong hands. It also limits the groups ability to expel a member who transgresses
the rules and needs to be punished. On the other hand, the use of a shared key
makes key management significantly easier which is a serious concern when you
need to rekey every few months. Additionally, using only one key reduces the
ability of the adversary to determine group size by examining the PGP packets.
It also removes the potential for a group member to reuse a key that is linked
to their real identity. See <a href="http://ritter.vg/blog-deanonymizing_amm.html">this excellent</a> presentation for more details on those attacks.</p>

<h2>Operational Activity: Recruitment</h2>

<p>The <em>enterprise</em> expanded by allowing new members to join. There were clear
guidelines, procedures and rules for expansion. First there was a background
check to ensure that the prospective member was an established and active
participant in the wider community of child abuse image traders. Then an existing
member has to invite the prospect to the group. Finally, to demonstrate both
their deep involvement in the activity and to prove they are not an undercover
cop, they must pass a timed written test on the minutiae of various child abuse
victims and media.</p>

<h3>Vetting</h3>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate active participation in the &#8220;trading scene&#8221;</li>
<li>Invited by existing member</li>
<li>Must exhibit deep domain specific knowledge via timed written test</li>
</ul>


<h2>Security Rules that Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Never reveal true identity to another member of the group</li>
<li>Never communicate with another member of the group outside the usenet channel</li>
<li>Group membership remains strictly within the confines of the Internet

<ul>
<li>No member can positively identify another</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Members do not reveal personally identifying information</li>
<li>Primary communications newsgroup is migrated regularly

<ul>
<li>If a member violates a security rule, e.g. fails to encrypt a message</li>
<li>Periodically to reduce chance of law enforcement discovery</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On each <strong>newsgroup migration</strong>

<ul>
<li>Create new PGP key pair, unlinking from previous messages</li>
<li>Each member creates a new nickname

<ul>
<li>Nickname theme selected by <em>Yardbird</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Root of Success</h2>

<p>The reason the majority of the group was able to avoid capture was in a small way
due to the technology they were using (Tor), but primarily it was adherence to the
security rules of the group. They had very good OPSEC and they followed it
consistently. Fundamentally, they had complete compartmentation within the group
&#8211; they did not reveal information to each other. The
law enforcement authorities were able to get logs of all their communications
traffic, plus logs of their IP addresses they used for posting. Everyone that
used Tor (as per the recommendation of <em>Yardbird</em>) was anonymous at the IP
layer. This protected them from a subpoena revealing their identity. As long as
there was no additional information that they had revealed about themselves in
their messages, they were secure against the opposition.</p>

<p>The use of PGP was essentially a No-OP in this case. It excluded the general
public from accessing the content of the communications traffic (and the child
abuse videos and images). It did not protect the traffic against analysis by the
opposition (who had successfully infiltrated the group). The encryption was not
a factor in their successful evasion. Rather, it was the content of the messages,
controlled and dictated by the security rules, which protected their secrets.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Guarding secrets involves not sharing them. Encryption can only ever protect the
content of a communique. Real security must start with the content itself, and
then use encryption as an additional layer.</p>

<h3>Note from the Editor</h3>

<p>(Feel free to skip this part if you don&#8217;t think studying how child pornographers
avoid capture is relevant)</p>

<p>When analyzing the activities of groups operating in an adversarial environment to learn what works, what doesn&#8217;t, and why, (unfortunately) the pool of covert organisations is somewhat limited: intelligence agencies; terrorist groups; hacker crews; narcos; insurgents; child pornographers&#8230; Few other groups face such a hostile operating environment that their security measures are really &#8220;tested&#8221;.</p>

<p>The group examined in this post had an incredibly effective set of security practices. They imposed strict compartmentation, regularly migrated identities and locations, required consistent Tor and PGP use, etc. They had legitimate punishments for people who transgressed the rules (expulsion) and they survived a massive investigation effort. Clearly, they were doing something right (actually a number of things).
Just as clearly, they are reprehensible people who engage in activity that is immoral and unethical, by any measure. (Paying for child pornography to be produced is flat out wrong, regardless on where you stand on the spectrum of <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2012/05/23/cynicism-redefined-why-the-copyright-lobby-loves-child-porn/">opinions regarding child porn laws</a>).</p>

<p>The thing is, there are basically no nice people who provide case studies of OPSEC practices. Most are engaged in violence, serious drug trafficking (at the &#8220;kill people for interfering&#8221; level), theft and manipulation of human beings, etc. Thats the nature of the beast.</p>

<p>People with well funded, trained and motivated adversaries have the strongest incentives to practice the highest level of security. They&#8217;re the ones to learn from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Everybody Was Hack Foo Fighting</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m going to discuss a serious problem with the organisational structure and
social dynamics of the hacker community, and why this puts hackers at risk.
Hackers operate essentially the same way as the henchmen in a kung fu movie:
they attack the adversary one by one by one&#8230; always losing. This is a terrible
way of developing a robust core of knowledge about which OPSEC techniques work,
which techniques fail, and why.</p>

<h2>Organisational Learning for Dummies</h2>

<p>There are two types of knowledge: individual, and organisational. Hackers are
very individualistic, and the knowledge they acquire tends to be very
practical; experience based. There are few hacker organisations that seek to
collect, retain, test and spread knowledge. The organistations that do crop up
are either some zines, which are knowledge artefacts that transmit techne, or
hacker groups, which share tool chains and experience. However, these hacker
groups have very short lifespans (measured in months and single digit years,
not decades). They are compartmented in that there is some effort made to
retain the group&#8217;s proprietary information, but internally they usually
have a very poor security posture. They are social groups in many ways, so
they are heavily compromised. As we say in infosec &#8220;crunchy on the outside,
chewy in the middle&#8221;.</p>

<p>Their opposition, the intelligence agencies and law enforcement departments,
have decades of organisational history and knowledge. The individual members
can display wide ranges of skill and competence, but the resources and core
knowledge of the organisation dwarf what any individual hacker has available.
Many of the skills that a hacker needs to learn, his clandestine tradecraft
and OPSEC, are the sort of skills that organisations are excellent at
developing and disseminating. These are not very good skillsets for an
individual to learn through trial and error, because those errors have
significant negative consequences. An organisation can afford to lose people
as it learns how to deal with the adversary; an individual cannot afford to
make a similar sacrifice &#8211; afterall, who would benefit from your negative
example?</p>

<h2>Challenges? More Like Opportunities!</h2>

<p>Hackers are facing some very serious challenges now:</p>

<ul>
<li>they lack organistations for collecting intelligence and knowledge about their adversary;</li>
<li>they face off against the adversary one at a time,</li>
<li>they learn very poorly from prior mistakes</li>
<li>they don&#8217;t even know what skills they need,</li>
<li>and perhaps most dangerously, they aren&#8217;t even aware they&#8217;re in the game</li>
</ul>


<p>It is amusing how many people think that interrogations involve violence and
torture. Successful elicitation far more frequently involves whiskey,
flattery, playing dumb, and being doubtful (&#8221;<em>really? I didn&#8217;t know it was
possible to do that. You must be pretty damn smart to have figured it
out&#8230;</em>&#8221;).</p>

<h2>Winning at Secrets</h2>

<p>There needs to be more information available on the techniques used during
investigations, as well as before they begin. There needs to be documentation
on how to evade those techniques, and why those evasions are successful. That
knowledge needs to be captured and dissemminated out to those who can use it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>25th Anniversary of STFU about your computer crimes</h2>

<p>Reading <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/05/heres-what-the-morris-worm-prosecutor-thinks-about-aaron-swartz/">this interview</a> with the prosecutor of Robert Morris Jr about the Morris Worm there are a few cool OPSEC lessons we can learn.</p>

<h2>How was Morris caught?</h2>

<blockquote><p>One way was with computer forensics. Tracing back the source of the worm. The second way was one of Morris&#8217;s friends told The New York Times in response to some articles that John Markoff was writing he inadvertently gave his initials.</p></blockquote>

<p>There were a couple of ways that he was discovered. The first was the forensic analysis of the worm itself, and tracing that back to the original infection point. This sort of evidence shows where to look (the original infection), but it does not provide enough information to successfully prosecute. It is circumstantial so far, and given some careful sanitisation of the original box, it would be a very hard case to prove.</p>

<p>The far more damaging way that Morris was caught was via an OSINT case officer doing HUMINT collection (a reporter interviewing people about the worm). The journo managed to elicit information about the worm&#8217;s author (his initials). This is the sort of extremely damaging information leakage that happens when there is poor OPSEC. There was no anti-interrogation training provided to the members of the Morris cell (i.e. all his friends who knew about the development of the worm).</p>

<h2>Deny everything. Admit nothing. Or, you know, not.</h2>

<blockquote><p>he did testify that he wrote the worm. He came in and testified, &#8220;I did it, and I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; I turned to my co-counsel and asked, &#8220;Should I prove he didn&#8217;t do it or he&#8217;s not sorry?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>When the prosecution has to prove that you committed a felonious act, it is a lot easier for them when you <strong>confess</strong> on the stand. I can&#8217;t second guess the decisions of Morris&#8217; legal counsel, but unless you are instructed to do so by your lawyer: STFU.</p>

<h2>The Morris Cell and &#8220;Need to know&#8221;</h2>

<blockquote><p>We talked to his friends. His friends were witnesses for us. They didn&#8217;t have a choice.
There was a core group. &#8230;one of the meetings where Robert Morris was discussing the worm occurred at a Legal Seafood in Kendall Square&#8230;
He talked about how it was developed, how it worked, what vulnerabilities it exploited. At one point he was at a meeting back at Harvard, he got so excited that he literally jumped up on a table pacing back and forth on the table explaining how it worked&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>The close friends of Robert Morris, the Morris Cell, were fully briefed on all aspects of the worm. Its capabilities, its functionality, and its author&#8217;s real identity. None of the other members of the cell were actively exposed to the risks of the operation. They had no &#8220;need to know&#8221;.</p>

<p>This failure to STFU, to properly compartment the design and development of the worm, was a key factor leading to his capture and prosecution. Fortunately, things worked out well for him, in the long run.</p>

<h2>How to evaluate &#8220;Need to know&#8221;</h2>

<p>The rule of thumb is: <em>if someone is actively sharing the risk, they have a need to know</em>. This need to know is, of course, restricted to only those aspects of the operation in which they are actively involved.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>OPSEC revisited</h2>

<blockquote><p>The goal of OPSEC is to control information about your capabilities and intentions to keep them from being exploited by your adversary.</p></blockquote>

<p>In typical hacker fashion, the term OPSEC has come to mean more than just information about capabilities and intentions, but also personal information about the yourself.</p>

<h2>Kerckoff&#8217;s Principle and OPSEC</h2>

<p>A common source for the idea that &#8220;security through obscurity is bad&#8221; is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27_principle">Kerckoffs&#8217; principle</a> which states that: <code>A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge</code>. OPSEC as a system of security is sometimes confused with &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221;. This is not the case. Such thinking reflects a confusion of both the problem with opaque security systems and the foundations of OPSEC.</p>

<h2>OPSEC is a System</h2>

<p>The way to clear this confusion, I believe, is to point out that OPSEC is a security system, not any one specific practice. The system itself is open source, in that we know how and why the various techniques and practices work. For example, the tradecraft technique of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_drop">dead drop</a> is public knowledge. The security of a dead drop is not that no one knows how they work, but rather the adversary does not know <strong>where</strong> a specific dead drop is locate, nor <strong>when</strong> that dead drop is being serviced (loaded or unload). That information, primarily the location of that dead drop, is the <strong>secret key</strong> to the dead drop security system. This information is what must remain secret for the dead drop to remain secure.</p>

<h2>Why OPSEC Works</h2>

<p>So OPSEC as a system of security does not violate Kerckoff&#8217;s principle, and is not &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221;. The specifics of any one application of OPSEC techniques provide security, but those are analogous to the private key to the system. If they are compromised, then security they provide will be be compromised.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Briefly, I would like to highlight some important considerations for good OPSEC. Firstly, OPSEC is a mode of operating, not a tool or a collection of tools. Secondly, OPSEC comes at a cost, and a significant part of that cost is efficiency. OPSEC is slow. Finally, maintaining a strong security posture (i.e. “good OPSEC”) for long periods of time is very stressful, even for professionally trained espionage officers.</p>

<p>Learning good OPSEC requires internalizing the behavioural changes required to continually maintain a strong security posture. The operational activities have to become habit, because the small things matter, and every careless mistake can compromise security. The only way to develop good OPSEC habits, good security hygiene, is to practice. Make the foolish beginners mistakes during a practice session, rather than in the field. Two relevant sayings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amateurs practice until they get it right, professionals practice until they can’t get it wrong</li>
<li>The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war</li>
</ul>


<p>After developing good security hygiene habits, the second most difficult thing about good OPSEC is learning patience. Increased OPSEC security comes at the cost of efficiency, primarily in communication time-frames. The OPSEC mechanisms that must be in place to reduce the risks during communication add latency. As a result, communication takes significantly longer and is less reliable. Obviously, this is more of an issue with time sensitive operations than those that have more generous deadlines.</p>

<p>The single greatest security risk is communication between operatives. Clandestine agencies, such as the CIA, MI6, DGSE, etc. will work incredibly hard to minimize the risks surrounding communication with their recruited agents. In the simplest form, this involves a 2-4 hour “surveillance detection route” (SDR) to see if they are “in the black” before they perform any operational activity. This is on top of the hours of planning for the operation itself (note: these are minimums, operations requiring high security might take weeks or months of planning, and 12 hour SDRs).</p>

<p>The technology that exists to facilitate information security, e.g. encryption, is important, but it is not sufficient or even the starting point for robust OPSEC. By all means, learn to use encryption software correctly and in a properly secure fashion. However, it is more important to compartment sensitive activities and structure your operational environment for impact containment than
install use particular software.</p>

<p>The dealers on Silk Road ship a large amount of illegal products around the world, and it is clear that they&#8217;re successful at it. However, the US Postal service has been aware that drug dealers user their service for shipping illegal substances and has developed guidelines for determining suspect packages efficiently. Unfortunately for them, those guidelines have leaked and this allows someone abusing the US mail as an illicit distribution channel to evade the USP&#8217;s checks.</p>

<h2>Suspicious Post Guidelines</h2>

<p>The actual <a href="http://teknopolitik.tumblr.com/post/48178417204/fbi-law-enforcement-bulletin-via-findarticles">guidelines for suspicious packages</a> list a number of major indicators that the inspectors look for. This guide is somewhat outdated, and a <a href="http://www.orlandocriminaldefenseattorneyblog.com/2012/05/drug-trafficking-via-express-m.html">revised version</a> has also be leaked. In both cases, the <strong>triggers</strong> and the reasoning behind them are similar.</p>

<h3>FBI Profiling Criteria</h3>

<ol>
<li>Heavy taping along the seams;</li>
<li>poor preparation for mailing;</li>
<li>uneven weight distribution;</li>
<li>apparent package reuse; and</li>
<li>labels that are handwritten, contain misspellings, originate from a drug-source State, indicate person-to-person not business-to-individual mail, have a return zip code that does not match the accepting post office zip code, a fictitious return address, names of senders or recipients with features in common (John Smith, e.g.) and having no connection to either address</li>
</ol>


<h3>Drug Mail Profile</h3>

<ol>
<li>the use of Express Mail,

<ul>
<li>Express Mail is primarily used by businesses for document delivery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the weight of the package,

<ul>
<li>drug traffickers are mailing approximately one kilo of cocaine per package, plus some dummy weights</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the package is sent from Puerto Rico, a known drug source location,</li>
<li>the package was mailed from a post office address outside of the zip code on the return address,</li>
<li>an Accurint check reveals that no one by the sender&#8217;s name lived at the return address,

<ul>
<li>Police will also check Google and Facebook to get more information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the package is heavily taped at all seams

<ul>
<li>heavy taping may or may not help evade detection by drug sniffing dogs&#8211;but we know one thing for sure&#8211;it certainly helps draw police attention to the package!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the label is handwritten

<ul>
<li>Since most Express Mail is business-to-business, or business-to-client, labels that aren&#8217;t typed are suspect</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Collated</h3>

<p>Anything that looks like someone is sending slightly over an even metric weight of <em>something</em>, from a known suspect location, to another person, in an old heavily taped package with a fake return address. Sounds like bad tradecraft.</p>

<ol>
<li>Suspicious packaging

<ul>
<li>Heavy taping</li>
<li>Package reuse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not business mail

<ul>
<li>No printed label</li>
<li>Clearly not documents</li>
<li>Individual to individual</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Known suspicious origin

<ul>
<li>Occasionally specific post offices</li>
<li>Specific countries (Puerto Rico)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flimsy &#8220;return address&#8221; cover

<ul>
<li>Fake name</li>
<li>Mismatched name + address</li>
<li>Mismatched address + zipcode</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Main points to take away:</p>

<ul>
<li>drug packages appear different from normal mail</li>
<li>many factors are contribute to creating a plausible cover/alias.</li>
<li>The packaging of a drug shipment provides a cover, which needs to be backstopped.</li>
</ul>


<p>Don&#8217;t make shit up, do your research and steal an identity with a real address.</p>

<h2>Backstop your cover</h2>

<p>When creating a cover, make sure it is as fully fleshed out as possible. This means developing supporting evidence to bolster the validity of the cover. In intelligence lingo, this is called backstopping.</p>

<p>A backstopped cover is one where checks to verify the authenticity of the cover story are verifiable. For example, if the cover story includes a name, there are matching identity documents; if there is an phone number, it connects to someone who will substantiate the cover story; if there is an address, it exists. The old Soviet illegals used to spend years developing their cover and backstopping them. They&#8217;d live for a few years in a country they claimed to be immigrating from, so they would have the memories, experience and verifiable evidence that they were from there.</p>

<p>If you are going to use a cover (you probably should), then put in the effort to create a backstop. The complexity and depth of that backstop are dependant on how deeply the cover will be investigated. Remember though, it is better to have too much, than not enough&#8230;</p>
