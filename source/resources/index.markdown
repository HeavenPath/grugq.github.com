Counterintelligence:
-------------------

* [Terrorism and Counterintelligence](http://www.amazon.com/Terrorism-Counterintelligence-Detection-Irregular-ebook/dp/B0092X9OBC)
 Read this book. This book is a seriously foundational work for understanding how counterintelligence is applied in the real world. 

* [Thwarting enemies at home and abroad](http://www.amazon.com/Thwarting-Enemies-Abroad-Counterintelligence-ebook/dp/B002HMBWQU)

* [Counterintelligence: Theory and Practice](http://www.amazon.com/Counterintelligence-Professional-Intelligence-Education-ebook/dp/B009GIPUL6/)
 A textbook for professionals learning CI theory and how to apply it to protecting an organisation (typically an Agency). It is a bit dry at times, but very solid. The Kindle version is completely broken, but can be fixed easily in Calibre.

* [From Pablo to Osama](http://www.amazon.com/From-Pablo-Osama-Trafficking-Bureaucracies/dp/0271029323)
 This book is an excellent follow up to *Terrorism and Counterintelligence* as it also explores practical real world CI.
