    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Of Bomb Threats and Tor</h1>

<p>Recently (December 16th, 2013) there was a <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/16/unconfirmed-reports-explosives-four-buildings/">bomb threat at Harvard University</a>, during finals week. The threat was a hoax, and the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/17/student-charged-bomb-threat/">FBI got their man</a> that very night. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzt0K7_O4qyqUlEtd2pUWE42amM/edit?usp=sharing">affidavit is here</a>.</p>

<p>This post will look at the tools and techniques the operative used to attempt
to hide his actions, why he failed, and what he should've done to improve his
OPSEC. As a hint: I provided an outline of what he should've done 6 months
ago in <a href="http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/06/13/ignorance-is-strength/">"<strong>ignorance is strength</strong>"</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This post is to outline why OPSEC is so difficult to get right,
even for people who go to Harvard. I am not encouraging any illegal behaviour,
but instead analyzing how OPSEC precautions can be so difficult to get right.
Don't send bomb threats.</p>

<h2>Strategic Objectives: Avoid Final Exam</h2>

<p>Strategically, the principal behind this operation (Eldo Kim) was attempting to avoid taking
a Final Exam scheduled for the morning of December 16th. To accomplish his objectives
he designed an operation that would cause an evacuation of the building where he
was to take his final. Rather than recruit an agent
and delegate the execution of the operation, the principal decided to do it himself.</p>

<p>This was not an enlightened decision.</p>

<h2>The Structure of All Things (for values of Things = "Operations")</h2>

<p>All offensive operations share a similar core structure. This structure has been
known for a long time in the military, but is rarely applied in other fields.
Operations have distinct phases that they move through as they progress from vague
idea, to concrete plan, through execution and, finally, onto the escape.</p>

<p>The outline framework for an operation, all of the phases, is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Target Selection</li>
<li>Planning (and Surveillance)</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
<li>Execution</li>
<li>Escape and Evasion</li>
</ol>


<p>This framework is frequently used when discecting a terrorist attack post mortem,
allowing the security forces to identify the agents involved in each phase. Idealy,
the security forces want to remove the people involved in the <em>Target Selection</em>
and <em>Planning</em> stages. These people tend to be the principals, and are more
valuable than the agents who actually perpetrate the attack.</p>

<p>For hacker groups, the operational phases are rarely acknowledged, and followed
in an ad hoc manner. Primarily because few hackers are aware of them. It would be
beneficial for hackers to understand the structure of preparing an operation
thoroughly, but that is an issue we'll address another day.</p>

<p>As an aside, it is worth noting that these operational phases apply to a
consultancy making a sale, providing a service, dropping a deliverable, and then
vanishing. ;)</p>

<h2>College Kids are Inexperienced, News at 11.</h2>

<p>All real criminals know that the most important part of an operation is the
get away, the <em>git</em> (as it used to be called). Of course, real criminals don't
go to Harvard University (although there's an argument to be made that some
graduate from there), and so poor Eldo Kim had no one to teach him the criticality
of the final stage of an operation: <strong>Escape and Evasion</strong>.</p>

<h2>Operation "Doomed to Failure"</h2>

<p>The operative used an ad hoc approach to his operational design, and as a result
he made a fatal error. Here is his operational plan:</p>

<p>Use Tor to connect to GuerrillaMail. Send an email to a target email address.
Create a new account for GuerrillaMail</p>

<ul>
<li>Obtain Tor Browser Bundle</li>
<li>Select target email addresses "randomly" [see para 11]</li>
<li><p>Compose email:
  shrapnel bombs placed in:</p>

<p>  science center
  sever hall
  emerson hall
  thayer hall</p>

<p>  2/4. guess correctly.</p>

<p>  be quick for they will go off soon</p></li>
<li>For each target email address

<ul>
<li>Create new GuerillaMail "account"</li>
<li>Send email (<a href="https://www.guerrillamail.com/compose">using this</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>For security, the operative chose to rely on a pseudonymous email tool and the
Tor anonymity network. It is likely that he used the Tor Browser Bundle rather
than the TAILS distribution (see: para 11). Provided he closed the tab between
each session, there should be no forensic evidence left on the laptop.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When using <strong>Tor Browser Bundle</strong> close all the tabs and exit the
application when you are done. The TBB will clean up thoroughly after itself,
<em>but only on exit</em>! When you are done, shut it down.</p>

<h3>Target Selection</h3>

<p>The strategic target was the hall hosting the final exam. Tactically, the
principal selected "email addresses at random" to recieve a bomb threat intended
to force an evacuation of the hall, along with a number of other cover locations.</p>

<h3>Planning</h3>

<p>This step appears to have been focussed solely on the technical requirements of
masking the origination of the threatening emails. However, insufficient resources
were devoted to this phase, and therefore it was fundamentally flawed.</p>

<h3>Deployment and Execution</h3>

<p>The operative chose to use GuerrillaMail to send the emails, and because
GuerrillaMail reveals the source IP of the sender, he also chose Tor to mask his
IP address. However, he used a monitored network to access Tor, which severely
limits the anonymity provided by Tor. This error was to prove fatal.</p>

<h3>Escape and Evasion</h3>

<p>There was nothing at all done for this phase.</p>

<h2>Counterintelligence: Know your Adversary</h2>

<p>A study of the methods of investigation used by the law enforcement officials
engaged to investigate bomb threats would have been beneficial for Mr Kim. He
would have realised that they would target the likely suspects, attempt to
narrow the suspect pool down to the minimum set, then start interviewing. The
more strongly the evidence points to a set of suspects, the more aggressive the
interviews will be. From "do you know anything about..." to "We have all the
evidence we need, why don't you make it easy for yourself?"</p>

<p>Initially the suspects for the case would have been any student scheduled to
take an exam
at one of the targeted halls. This is doubtless a large number, and without any
specific information to go on, the chance of interviewing all of them is slim.
If, however, the FBI did interview all of them, the questioning would be general
and undirected, rather than specific and probing. An amateur, like Kim, who kept
his cool and simply denied any knowledge of the hoax would have had a reasonable
chance of evading suspicion.</p>

<p>Knowing the investigative techniques of his adversary would have allowed Kim to
design an operation that provided for a reliable escape and evasion phase. He
would have used an unmonitored network, in an unmonitored location near by the
school, to send his threats. This would have left the suspect pool extremely
large -- "everyone".</p>

<p>When planning an operation, know how the adversary will respond. This will allow
you to factor that response into your planning. If you do not know how your
adversary will respond, then their response will be a surprise. Do not allow
the reactive force to surprise you.</p>

<h2>There is no OPSEC magic sauce</h2>

<p><strong>What He Should Have Done</strong> the content and context of the threat make it clear
that the originator of the emails was a student (or possibly a professor/TA trying
to avoid grading exams). The important thing to hide is <strong>which</strong> student, not
that it was a student. Therefore simply using a nearby cafe with free wifi should
have been sufficient to mask the specific identity of the operative. Assuming:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are cafe's that do not know the operative by sight,</li>
<li>there are cafe's that are not monitored by CCTV (where a hat, don't look up),</li>
<li>that he wore a simple disguise to reduce the recall of the witnesses (look generic), and</li>
<li>that a college kid in a cafe at 8am during Finals week is not unusual</li>
</ul>


<p>Using Tor from the college campus was a fatal error. The pool of suspects was
immediately reduced to "everyone that used Tor during the time the bomb threats
were sent". Since Silk Road v1 has been shut down, that is obviously going to be
a small number.</p>

<h2>Lets call it half a win</h2>

<p>Strategically, the operation was successful. Eldo Kim will not have to take his
final exam. Or, indeed, other final exams he might not be prepared for. However,
it is hard to imagine this is the outcome he was hoping for.</p>

    <link href="http://grugq.github.com/blog/2013/11/22/challenges-for-hackers/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-22T20:02:00+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://grugq.github.com/blog/2013/11/22/challenges-for-hackers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Everybody Was Hack Foo Fighting</h2>

<p>I'm going to discuss a serious problem with the organisational structure and
social dynamics of the hacker community, and why this puts hackers at risk.
Hackers operate essentially the same way as the henchmen in a kung fu movie:
they attack the adversary one by one by one... always losing. This is a terrible
way of developing a robust core of knowledge about which OPSEC techniques work,
which techniques fail, and why.</p>

<h2>Organisational Learning for Dummies</h2>

<p>There are two types of knowledge: individual, and organisational. Hackers are
very individualistic, and the knowledge they acquire tends to be very
practical; experience based. There are few hacker organisations that seek to
collect, retain, test and spread knowledge. The organistations that do crop up
are either some zines, which are knowledge artefacts that transmit techne, or
hacker groups, which share tool chains and experience. However, these hacker
groups have very short lifespans (measured in months and single digit years,
not decades). They are compartmented in that there is some effort made to
retain the group's proprietary information, but internally they usually
have a very poor security posture. They are social groups in many ways, so
they are heavily compromised. As we say in infosec "crunchy on the outside,
chewy in the middle".</p>

<p>Their opposition, the intelligence agencies and law enforcement departments,
have decades of organisational history and knowledge. The individual members
can display wide ranges of skill and competence, but the resources and core
knowledge of the organisation dwarf what any individual hacker has available.
Many of the skills that a hacker needs to learn, his clandestine tradecraft
and OPSEC, are the sort of skills that organisations are excellent at
developing and disseminating. These are not very good skillsets for an
individual to learn through trial and error, because those errors have
significant negative consequences. An organisation can afford to lose people
as it learns how to deal with the adversary; an individual cannot afford to
make a similar sacrifice -- afterall, who would benefit from your negative
example?</p>

<h2>Challenges? More Like Opportunities!</h2>

<p>Hackers are facing some very serious challenges now:</p>

<ul>
<li>they lack organistations for collecting intelligence and knowledge about their adversary;</li>
<li>they face off against the adversary one at a time,</li>
<li>they learn very poorly from prior mistakes</li>
<li>they don't even know what skills they need,</li>
<li>and perhaps most dangerously, they aren't even aware they're in the game</li>
</ul>


<p>It is amusing how many people think that interrogations involve violence and
torture. Successful elicitation far more frequently involves whiskey,
flattery, playing dumb, and being doubtful ("<em>really? I didn't know it was
possible to do that. You must be pretty damn smart to have figured it
out...</em>").</p>

<h2>Winning at Secrets</h2>

<p>There needs to be more information available on the techniques used during
investigations, as well as before they begin. There needs to be documentation
on how to evade those techniques, and why those evasions are successful. That
knowledge needs to be captured and dissemminated out to those who can use it.</p>

    <id>http://grugq.github.com/blog/2013/10/10/silk-road-security</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Counterintelligence Lessons for Drug Dealers</h2>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Events have overtaken my slow writing speed. This post was in the works
before the Silk Road bust in September 2013. I'm uploading it anyway because it
has some useful information, however there seems little point in finish it now.</p>

<p>The dealers on Silk Road ship a large amount of illegal products around the world, and it is clear that they're successful at it. However, the US Postal service has been aware that drug dealers user their service for shipping illegal substances and has developed guidelines for determining suspect packages efficiently. Unfortunately for them, those guidelines have leaked and this allows someone abusing the US mail as an illicit distribution channel to evade the USP's checks.</p>

<h2>Suspicious Post Guidelines</h2>

<p>The actual <a href="http://teknopolitik.tumblr.com/post/48178417204/fbi-law-enforcement-bulletin-via-findarticles">guidelines for suspicious packages</a> list a number of major indicators that the inspectors look for. This guide is somewhat outdated, and a <a href="http://www.orlandocriminaldefenseattorneyblog.com/2012/05/drug-trafficking-via-express-m.html">revised version</a> has also be leaked. In both cases, the <strong>triggers</strong> and the reasoning behind them are similar.</p>

<h3>FBI Profiling Criteria</h3>

<ol>
<li>Heavy taping along the seams;</li>
<li>poor preparation for mailing;</li>
<li>uneven weight distribution;</li>
<li>apparent package reuse; and</li>
<li>labels that are handwritten, contain misspellings, originate from a drug-source State, indicate person-to-person not business-to-individual mail, have a return zip code that does not match the accepting post office zip code, a fictitious return address, names of senders or recipients with features in common (John Smith, e.g.) and having no connection to either address</li>
</ol>


<h3>Drug Mail Profile</h3>

<ol>
<li>the use of Express Mail,

<ul>
<li>Express Mail is primarily used by businesses for document delivery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the weight of the package,

<ul>
<li>drug traffickers are mailing approximately one kilo of cocaine per package, plus some dummy weights</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the package is sent from Puerto Rico, a known drug source location,</li>
<li>the package was mailed from a post office address outside of the zip code on the return address,</li>
<li>an Accurint check reveals that no one by the sender's name lived at the return address,

<ul>
<li>Police will also check Google and Facebook to get more information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the package is heavily taped at all seams

<ul>
<li>heavy taping may or may not help evade detection by drug sniffing dogs--but we know one thing for sure--it certainly helps draw police attention to the package!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the label is handwritten

<ul>
<li>Since most Express Mail is business-to-business, or business-to-client, labels that aren't typed are suspect</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Collated</h3>

<p>Anything that looks like someone is sending slightly over an even metric weight of <em>something</em>, from a known suspect location, to another person, in an old heavily taped package with a fake return address. Sounds like bad tradecraft.</p>

<ol>
<li>Suspicious packaging

<ul>
<li>Heavy taping</li>
<li>Package reuse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not business mail

<ul>
<li>No printed label</li>
<li>Clearly not documents</li>
<li>Individual to individual</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Known suspicious origin

<ul>
<li>Occasionally specific post offices</li>
<li>Specific countries (Puerto Rico)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flimsy "return address" cover

<ul>
<li>Fake name</li>
<li>Mismatched name + address</li>
<li>Mismatched address + zipcode</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Main points to take away:</p>

<ul>
<li>drug packages appear different from normal mail</li>
<li>many factors are contribute to creating a plausible cover/alias.</li>
<li>The packaging of a drug shipment provides a cover, which needs to be backstopped.</li>
</ul>


<p>Don't make shit up, do your research and steal an identity with a real address.</p>

<h2>Backstop your cover</h2>

<p>When creating a cover, make sure it is as fully fleshed out as possible. This means developing supporting evidence to bolster the validity of the cover. In intelligence lingo, this is called backstopping.</p>

<p>A backstopped cover is one where checks to verify the authenticity of the cover story are verifiable. For example, if the cover story includes a name, there are matching identity documents; if there is an phone number, it connects to someone who will substantiate the cover story; if there is an address, it exists. The old Soviet illegals used to spend years developing their cover and backstopping them. They'd live for a few years in a country they claimed to be immigrating from, so they would have the memories, experience and verifiable evidence that they were from there.</p>

<p>If you are going to use a cover (you probably should), then put in the effort to create a backstop. The complexity and depth of that backstop are dependant on how deeply the cover will be investigated. Remember though, it is better to have too much, than not enough...</p>

    <updated>2013-10-07T06:41:00+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://grugq.github.com/blog/2013/10/07/drug-delivery-service-opsec</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some interesting lessons on how a modern New York City drug delivery service
uses basic tradecraft to create a reasonable security posture.</p>

<h2>The Source</h2>

<p>This <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/confessions-of-a-drug-dealers-delivery-service-guy">Vice article</a>
provides the source of the information for this blog post. Using some
basic background knowledge on how covert groups operate, it is simple to parse
and analyze the drug delivery service tradecraft.</p>

<h2>Recruitment</h2>

<blockquote><p>a friend of mine solicited hardcore drugs for a Manhattan drug kingpin, who was looking for a new pot delivery guy. My friend encouraged me to try out for the job.</p></blockquote>

<p>As with many covert groups, the recruitment process relied on personal connections.
This <strong>social network</strong> grounded approach to expanding a covert organisation
is generally good for initial security. The recruits are unlikely to be agents
sent to infiltrate the organistation as the long standing social ties between
members and recruits both establishes trust and serves as <strong>vetting</strong>.</p>

<p>Developing a covert organisation based on <strong>social network</strong> ties provides a
means of rapid expansion and easy security clearance. The downside is that once
a single member of the organisation is compromised, the adversarial security forces
can easily roll up the whole network. The poor compartmentation of a <strong>social network</strong>
based covert organisation is its Achilles heel. The security of the organisation
is critically dependent on the security of each individual member.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> Expand your covert network with individuals who are passionate about
your ideological beliefs. Ensure strong compartmentation, starting with recruitment.</p>

<h2>Leverage</h2>

<blockquote><p>He asked me to provide documentation of my current address and phone number as an insurance policy. If I ran out on him, he warned me he’d hold my friends responsible for the deficit funds and/or drugs.</p></blockquote>

<p>The principal of the organisation "Nathan" requires that the recruit provide
a verifiable address and means of contact, along with dire warnings of consequences
in the case of infractions. This is very basic control principles, typical of
covert organisations.</p>

<p>The major security problem with this approach, of course, is that the records
maintained by the network's principal are a high value target for the adversary.
Compromise of the principal's records will lead to total collapse of the network,
and interdiction for every member involved. There is no chance of evasion.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> No logs, no crime. Do not keep records of the members of your covert
organisation. These records are extremely sensitive.</p>

<h2>Operational Actions</h2>

<blockquote><p> the transaction and exit should be as swift as possible. “You aren't here to hang out,” she said. “It's not a social call, and they aren't your friends. You want to walk in and be friendly and make conversation but also get to the business at hand and get out of there quickly.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The illicit operation, the drug sale, is intended to be rapid and minimize
the period of vulnerability for both parties. Interestingly, this is possibly a
poor choice if the threat is surveillance. There are few reasons a random individual
would enter a domicile for a short duration. Also of note, the covert organisation
provides no reasonable cover story for why the agent (the drug courier) is entering
the residence of the client. A simple "what were you doing?" type question would
likely completely blow the whole operation.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> Minimising the period of vulnerability improves the chances of operational
success. Always make sure your agents are capable of delivering plausible cover
stories. <strong>Cover for action</strong></p>

<h2>Cover for Status</h2>

<blockquote><p>Nathan forced me to wear a button-up shirt and slacks, shave my face, and keep my hair conservatively short. He believed this uniform would attract little attention as I walked around with thousands of dollars worth of pot in a laptop case slung over my shoulder.</p></blockquote>

<p>The covert organisation has, surprisingly enough, chosen to enforce a uniform
that makes their agents blend in with the mainstream. This is completely inline
with the typical operational disguises employed by covert organistations operating
in controlled territory the world over. (See: Moscow Rules <code>go with the flow</code>;
Murphy's Laws of War: <code>don't stand out, it draws fire</code>)</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> They got this one exactly right.</p>

<h2>All phones are bugged</h2>

<blockquote><p>Although I used my flip-phone constantly at work, I was never given clients' addresses over the phone. Clients calls would go to a dispatcher—a third party who took the call, traced the number through a database of numbers, and then returned the call from a different phone to confirm their request for drugs. After their request was confirmed, I received a call from another phone. The dispatcher only told me, “You got Nick,” or “You got Lucy.” I was banned from responding with anything besides a murmured “OK.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Each operational use of the phone provides the adversary with minimal value.
There is a unique identifier for the client (e.g. "Lucy"), and the agent
acknowledges receipt of the directive ("OK"). The dispatchers interaction
with the client is itself run over multiple phone lines and kept to short,
simple, normal statements.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> This is very much inline with all covert organisations'
guidelines for using phones. Never use keywords, keep the content as vague as possible,
minimize the period of vulnerability -- get off the phone!</p>

<h2>OPSEC FAIL: attracting attention</h2>

<blockquote><p>Each day I was given a stipend of $40 for cabs. No one knew if I didn’t spend the $40. Instead of taking cabs, I ran around in a frantic state that negated every other measure I took to not draw unwanted attention</p></blockquote>

<p>This is an instance of <strong>preference divergence</strong>, a common problem for covert
organisations. The financial resources provided to the agent of the principal
are siphoned off and directed towards non-operational uses (the drug courier
skims and pockets his cab stipend.) There doesn't appear to be any consequence
to this operational security failure, however it jeopardizes the entire organisation.
If "Nathan" were a more disciplined principal he would monitor his agents more
closely and ensure they are conforming to the organisational security requirements.
Strangely, drug dealers are not strict disciplinarians.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> if the securit of the entire organisation is dependent on the security
of each individual agent -- enforce the operational security requirements strictly!</p>

<h2>Aliases</h2>

<blockquote><p> I shook his hand and said, “I'm Jack.” He gave me a knowing grin. “So that's the name you're using?” he asked.</p></blockquote>

<p>The agent is using an alias to provide pseudonymity from malicious clients. This
provides some minimal level of security. It is definitely better than not having
any cover at all. However, as noted above, it should be combined with a robust
cover story for why the agent is visiting a residential home for a brief period.</p>

<h2>Discharging the agent</h2>

<p>After a promotion, the drug courier decides to find a new line of work. If the
organisation was stricter in their OPSEC practices, the departure of an agent
wouldn't place anyone else in jeopardy. As it stands, it seems clear that the
agent who is now drawing attention to himself by writing about his experience
in a national magazine(!) still retains sufficiently sensitive information to
unravel the network.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> compartment early, compartment often. It is safer than any alternative.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Compartment your covert organisation from recruitment through to operational
action so that when your agents leave or are compromised they are unable
to compromise the organisation. Ensure that your operational activities have
good <strong>cover for status</strong> (e.g. a disguise) and <strong>cover for action</strong> (e.g. a strong cover story).
Strong compartmentation, strong cover, and be aware of the risks of using social networks
for building a covert organisation.</p>
