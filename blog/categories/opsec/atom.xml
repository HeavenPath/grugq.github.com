    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>Paddy Factor</strong> was a disparaging term used by the British security
forces to refer to poor OPSEC practices by the Provisional IRA (PIRA)
in the early 1970s. Much of this terrible counter intelligence posture was due
to a limited number of easily avoidable activities that combined to compromise
many Provos:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Self incrimination</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PIRA members would congregate in pubs and sing IRA songs.</li>
<li>They would boast about their IRA operations while drunk in pubs.</li>
<li>They would reply with a nod and a wink to friendly inquiries about their
activities, making it easy for informants to identify them.</li>
<li>They would march in pro-IRA rallies.</li>
</ul>


<p>  <strong>Problem:</strong> The adversary was able to easily identify (some) PIRA
  members. Once the adversary identifies members of an organisation,
  they will investigate and monitor them to uncover other members.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contamination</strong>
  PIRA members would associate with each other when not on operations.
  In intel parlance this is called "pre-operational contact", and it is
  to be avoided. The reason is that any surveillance on one member will
  reveal the other members of the group. This is a form of <em>contamination</em>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In short, some (many?) members of the Provisional IRA made their affiliation
publically known by bragging about their operations in public places. This
made them known to the adversary (the British security forces), who were then
able to monitor those known PIRA members. Later, at political events such as
rallies, these known PIRA members would hang out and chat with their unknown
underground brethren. This made the underground members known to the adversary,
with the obvious negative consequences.</p>

<h2>Link Analysis and You</h2>

<p>Knowing only a single node in a network, e.g. one member of an organisation,
and monitoring which other nodes it contacts with gives insight into
membership of the graph. The police, for example, use a variety of monitoring
techniques to build up <em>phone trees</em> which map out organisational relationships.</p>

<p>This form of analysis, mapping associations between nodes in a network (e.g.
membership in an organisation) is called link analysis. It can be used against
communication end points (e.g. mobile phones, email addresses), which are then
associated with individuals. For example, link analysis of mobile phone numbers
and contact address books of drug dealers is used to determine hierarchical
information about their distribution networks. Link analysis is a very powerful
method of understanding relationships and being able to link "chatter" between
nodes as activity related to an organisation.</p>

<h2>How to unlink</h2>

<p>One solution to making link analysis harder and less useful is to create
unique nodes for each connection. Done successfuly, this creates link graph is
only 2 nodes and 1 edge. In practise, this means that every connection between
peers should be unique to that connection, i.e. create a new jabber identity for
each associate you have. Do not share these jabber IDs between different <em>friends</em>.
The rule is simple: 1 friend, 1 jabber ID.</p>

<p>These node to node links should be changed regularly as well. The old nodes
must never contact the new nodes. That will contaminate them, create a link
that associates them together. New clean break each time.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It is possible to defeat link analysis, but it takes discipline and is hard to
do successfully. Every single communications end point must be unique and
dedicated to only one other end point. These end points must never contaminate
each other by interacting or mentioning other end points. This will inhibit
creating a <em>phone tree</em>, or link analysis chart of organisation membership.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> unlinking will not prevent traffic flow analysis, fingerprinting,
or many other techniques from linking comms end points. But it is square one.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Anonymity in the real world is very hard</h2>

<p>In late 2011 Hezbollah rolled up a CIA spy ring in Lebanon. This provides an
interesting lesson in CIA tradecraft and real world counterintelligence. Close
examination of the techniques used to track down the agents will reveal some
serious problems with many systems designed to provide security for
anti-government groups.</p>

<p>This post is partially in a response to <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/03/here-come-encryption-apps.html">Matt Green's</a>
post about encryption apps. The secrecy provided by encryption applications,
primarily privacy of communication content, is not sufficient to protect against
even minimal monitoring. Any anti-government activity in a modern environment, e.g.
one involving mobile phones and the internet, needs to include anonymity first and
foremost.</p>

<h2>The Sources</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/9958834">This article</a> provides
some of the details about the tradecraft of the spy network, and how it
failed. The focus is on how the agents were contacted by their handlers and
how this was used to uncover the whole network. <a href="http://www.ufppc.org/us-a-world-news-mainmenu-35/10702-news-three-us-spy-rings-broken-in-lebanon-a-iran.html">Another site</a>
provides a large collection of related articles which fills in some additional
details.</p>

<h2>The Tradecraft (Probably, maybe)</h2>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This information is based on newspaper articles, so it is of limited
accuracy. However, it seems like reasonable tradecraft practices that even
amateurs would devise and is thus presented for analysis here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dedicated mobile phone</strong>
  The agents had a mobile phone used specifically for communication with
  their handler. This phone was kept in a static location waiting for
  contact, and possibly spent a lot of time switched off.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-arranged meeting place</strong>
  The agents had a meeting location (allegedly at a Pizza Hut) where
  they met their handlers. This location was (allegedly) reused for
  multiple agents and multiple meetings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Signalling code word</strong>
  Contact by the handler to the agent was via a code word (allegedly: "PIZZA!"),
  which was meaningless by itself but also contextually anomalous.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Well, thats one way to do it</h2>

<p>The adversary, Hezbollah, used access to the telephone company logs (they have those),
and searched for atypical mobile phone usage patterns:</p>

<ul>
<li>phones that only receive a few calls / messages over long periods of time</li>
<li>mobile phones that are never mobile</li>
<li>weird / unusual messages (PIZZA!!)</li>
</ul>


<p>That is, they were looking for phones that were kept at home, turned on
occasionally, and only received calls/sms infrequently. The exact usage pattern
one would expect for a mobile that is used exclusively for a handler to contact
an agent.</p>

<p>This data gave Hezbollah a general location (down to the apartment complex) of
where the agents were located. Next, the adversary correlated the location
data with the home addresses of members who had access to secret information.
They conducted surveillance on those members and discovered they were using a
Pizza Hut to meet with their handlers.</p>

<p><strong>Speculation</strong>
Finally, the adversary was able to continually monitor the meeting location
and detect other members of the spy network meeting with their handlers. The
CIA is known for over using the same locations for meetings [1].</p>

<p>[1] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-C-I-Desk-Counterintelligence-Cubicle/dp/1608447391">The C.I. Desk</a></p>

<h2>Computer says No</h2>

<p>The problems with these tradecraft practises are pretty obvious from a
counterintelligence analysis. They are anomalous (atypical mobile phone use)
and they are rigidly predictable (reusing the same meeting location).</p>

<p>For encryption applications used by anti-government forces this provides a
clear blueprint for action - look normal. Even basic monitoring of traffic
will reveal anomalous activity which can be used to identify who needs to be
watched more closely.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hiding anomalous activity is hard, but vitally important. The problem with
many security systems based purely on secrecy is that their usage is itself
anomalous. It singles out and attracts attention to the users. If the
adversary doesn't know who those users are initially, they can cross correlate
real world data with the suspicious activity and narrow their focus to real
people. Those people can, and will, end up dead.</p>

    <link href="http://grugq.github.com/blog/2013/03/11/opsec-lessons-from-resevoir-dogs/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-11T00:00:00+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://grugq.github.com/blog/2013/03/11/opsec-lessons-from-resevoir-dogs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>The cult movie classic Reservoir Dogs distills and imparts a number of important
operational security (OPSEC) lessons. Although a work of fiction, the counter
intelligence measures enacted by the gang were real standard operating procedure
(SOP) for terrorist groups such as Fatah and the Black September Organisation
(BSO). These OPSEC methods provide effective protection against informants
participating in the operation. The weakness for this SOP is from informants at
a higher level who have oversight of the operation.</p>

<h2>The Reservoir Dogs OPSEC SOP</h2>

<h3>Procedure 1: Assigned Operational Aliases</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Operational aliases for the duration of the op assigned by the organisation</strong></p>

<p>  Using random aliases unique to the operation reduces the information
  available to informants who are involved in the op.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Procedure 2: Rapidly assembled cherry picked team</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Just In Time team formation</strong></p>

<p>  Creating the team just when it is needed reduces the time available for
  informants to find out about an operation and report it back to their
  handlers.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Procedure 3: Dedicated operational support teams</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dedicated Independant Operational Teams</strong></p>

<p>  Dedicated teams conducting operational support roles ensures that each
  team, and its members, knows only their own small portion of the plan.
  For example, the pre-operational intelligence and surveillance are
  conducted by dedicated teams, separate from the team that conducts the
  operation.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Strengths:</h2>

<p>This SOP provides a number of important protections against monitoring and
infiltration by security forces.</p>

<h3>Secret Agents</h3>

<p>The agents are kept undercover until they are required to fulfill mission
objectives. This both protects them against discovery by security forces, and
also limits the quantity and quality of information available to any
informants. For maximum effectiveness team is formed immediately prior to
preoperational training and then kept isolated until after the operation is
complete.</p>

<h3>Mr Pink</h3>

<p>Using assigned aliases limits the information that an informant can gather
during an operation. Because the aliases are assigned rather than chosen, it
is not possible for an agent to develop a preference for a particular alias and
thus create an identity.</p>

<h2>Weaknesses:</h2>

<p>The Reservoir Dogs OPSEC SOP has a number of inherent weaknesses which can:
limit its effectiveness; expose large numbers of agents to capture, and even
directly lead to mission failure.</p>

<h3>Inefficient Teams</h3>

<p>Ad Hoc hastily assembled teams are less effecient, and possibly less
effective, than long standing teams. The team lifecycle of:
Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing is compacted into a reduced timeframe
which inhibits achieving the higher levels of efficiency.</p>

<h3>High Value Targets</h3>

<p>Talent pool exposed to high level members. Knowledge of the group's membership
is heavily concentrated in a few individuals, rather than dispersed amongst
the rank-and-file. These select individuals become high value targets in
position to cause significant damage to the group if compromised.</p>

<h3>Single Point of Failure</h3>

<p>Single point of failure. The operational team captain is the only member of
the team who knows the complete operation plan. The individual team members
are unable to carry on the mission should the captain be eliminated.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>The Reservoir Dogs OPSEC SOP is an effective collection of techniques to protect
a large group of agents against internal informants. The threat of a compromised
internal member of a group is very likely the single greatest threat facing an
underground organisation. This is demonstrated by the extreme lengths the PIRA
went to hunting down informants, the dismantling of Lulzsec via a highly placed
penetration, the extreme violence visited upon criminal informants ("snitches",
and "rats"), etc. etc. The Resevoir Dogs SOP provides a methodology to mitigate
against all but the highest level penetrations.</p>
