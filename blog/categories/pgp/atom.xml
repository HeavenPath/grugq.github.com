<blockquote><p>If your secure communications platform isn't being used by terrorists and pedophiles, you're probably doing it wrong. -- [REDACTED]</p></blockquote>

<p>A few years ago a group of child pornographers was infiltrated by police who were
able to monitor, interact, and aggressively investigate the members. Despite
engaging in a 15 month undercover operation, only one in three of the pedophiles
were successfully apprehended. The majority, including the now infamous leader
<em>Yardbird</em>, escaped capture. The dismal success rate of the law enforcement
officials was due entirely to the strict security rules followed by the group.</p>

<p>This post will examine those rules, the reasons for their success, and the
problems the group faced which necessitated those rules.</p>

<h2>Covert Organizations, Seen One, Seen 'em All</h2>

<p>All covert organizations face a similar set of problems as they attempt to execute
on their fundamental mission -- to <strong>continue to exist</strong>. A covert organization
in an adversarial environment faces a number of organizational challenges and
constraints. Fundamentally how it handles trade-offs between operational
security and efficiency mandates how group members perform their operational
activities. Strong OPSEC means low efficiency, while high efficiency necessitates
weak OPSEC. The strength of the oppositional forces dictate the minimum security
requirements of the covert organization.</p>

<p>Examining the operational activities -- those actions the organization must engage
in to self perpetuate -- allows us to evaluate their operational security decisions
within their environmental context.</p>

<h3>Operational Activities:</h3>

<p>The <em>Yardbird</em> child abuse media group had a number of core goals that had to be
addressed to continue operation: they needed to distribute their child abuse
content to their members; communicate between members; raise funds to acquire
new content; recruit new members (presumably for access to additional child abuse
content).</p>

<p>Explicitly stated, here is an enumerated list of the operational activities that
the group had to engage in to self perpetuate.</p>

<ol>
<li>Distribution of Child Abuse Content</li>
<li>Communication and Coordinate Action</li>
<li>Fund raising</li>
<li>Recruitment and Vetting</li>
</ol>


<p>Pretty typical activities for a clandestine group. Besides their core defining
operational activity, they have a communications channel, fund raising and
membership management.</p>

<h2>Security Forces Interdict Moron Pedo</h2>

<p>Mr Castleman, of affidavit fame, was apparently engaged in child abuse image
distribution outside the <em>enterprise</em>. This activity, which was conducted
without the protection of an anonymisation platform (e.g. Tor) and was registered
to his real identity.</p>

<p>During his plea bargain phase, Mr Castleman turned informant on the <em>enterprise</em>
and provided the police with complete archival logs and access</p>

<h2>A Frustrating Infiltration</h2>

<p>The law enforcement authorities were about to completely penetrate the <em>enterprise</em>
for a 15 month period from 2006-08-31 through 2007-12-15. During that time the
group's posted 400,000 images and 1,1000 videos. The <em>enterprise</em> had approximately
45 active members, although <a href="http://alt.privacy.anon-server.narkive.com/VRl3dTFH/the-fourth-of-yardbird-s-chums-grabs-his-ankles">independent observers</a> have claimed this is low with
the real membership anywhere from 48 to 61.</p>

<p>The total number of arrests was 14, or somewhere around 1/3rd. A fully staffed,
highly motivated, well trained adversarial force with complete penetration of
a large complacent group was only about to achieve a one in three success rate.
The majority of those successes were achieved due to group members being insufficiently
cautious and violating the <em>enterprise</em> security rules. Obviously, these security
rules are extremely resilient against adversarial assault.</p>

<h2>Operational Activity: Distribution</h2>

<p>The <em>enterprise</em> was careful to ensure that the location of the encrypted files
containing child abuse images was a different newsgroup. They compartmented their
commo from their file sharing. As an additional, although superfluous step, the
<em>enterprise</em> would apparently alter the sequence number of the split binary
uploads so that reassembly would be hampered. What this cumbersome step added
beyond the existing PGP encryption.</p>

<h2>Operational Activity: Communications</h2>

<p>The <em>enterprise</em> would use the primary newsgroup, at the start of the investigation
<code>alt.anonymous.messages</code>, to announce the location of a media cache for group
members. The communications newsgroup is always reserved strictly for communications.
The announcements regarding new downloads provided detailed instructions as to
the location of the child abuse content, plus how to download, assemble and decrypt it.</p>

<h2>Operational Activity: Recruitment</h2>

<p>The <em>enterprise</em> expanded by allowing new members to join. There were clear
guidelines, procedures and rules for expansion. First there is a background
check to ensure that the prospective member is an established and active
participant in the wider community of child abuse image traders. Then an exhisting
member has to invite the prospect to the group. Finally, to demonstrate both
their deep involvement in the activity and to prove they are not an infiltrating
police, they must pass a timed written test.</p>

<h3>Vetting</h3>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate active participation in the "trading scene"</li>
<li>Invited by existing member</li>
<li>Must exhibit deep domain specific knowledge via timed written test</li>
</ul>


<h2>Rules for Radicals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Never reveal true identity to another member of the group</li>
<li>Never communicate with another member of the group outside the usenet channel</li>
<li>Group membership remains strictly within the confines of the Internet

<ul>
<li>No member can positively identify another</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Members do not reveal personally identifying information</li>
<li>Primary communications newsgroup is migrated regularly

<ul>
<li>If a member violates a security rule, e.g. fails to encrypt a message</li>
<li>Periodically to reduce chance of law enforcement discovery</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Newsgroup Migration</strong>

<ul>
<li>Create new PGP key pair, so there is no contamination linking them</li>
<li>Create a new nickname

<ul>
<li>Nickname theme selected by <em>Yardbird</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Root of Success</h2>

<p>The reason the majority of the group was able to avoid capture was in a small way
due to the technology they were using (Tor), but mostly it was adherence to the
security rules of the group. They did not reveal information to each other. The
law enforcement authorities were able to get logs of all their communications
traffic, plus logs of their IP addresses they used for posting. Everyone that
used Tor (as per the recommendation of <em>Yardbird</em>) was anonymous at the IP
layer. This protected them from a subpoena revealing their identity.</p>

<p>The use of PGP was essentially a No-OP in this case. It excluded the general
public from accessing the content of the communications traffic and the child
abuse videos and images. It did not protect the traffic against analysis by the
opposition (who had successfully infiltrated the group). The encryption was not
a factor in their successful evasion. Rather, it was the content of the messages,
controlled and dictated by the security rules, which protected their secrets.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Guarding secrets involves not sharing them. Encryption can only ever protect the
content of a communique. Real security must start with the content itself, and
then use encryption as an additional layer.</p>

<h3>Note from the Editor</h3>

<p>(Feel free to skip this part if you don't think studying how child pornographers
avoid capture is relevant)</p>

<p>When analyzing the activities of groups operating in an adversarial environment to learn what works, what doesn't, and why, (unfortunately) the pool of covert organisations is somewhat limited: intelligence agencies; terrorist groups; hacker crews; narcos; insurgents; child pornographers... Few other groups face such a hostile operating environment that their security measures are really "tested".</p>

<p>The group examined in this post had an incredibly effective set of security practices. They imposed strict compartmentation, regularly migrated identities and locations, required consistent Tor and PGP use, etc. They had legitimate punishments for people who transgressed the rules (expulsion) and they survived a massive investigation effort. Clearly, they were doing something right (actually a number of things).
Just as clearly, they are reprehensible people who engage in activity that is immoral and unethical, by any measure. (Paying for child pornography to be produced is flat out wrong, regardless on where you stand on the spectrum of <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2012/05/23/cynicism-redefined-why-the-copyright-lobby-loves-child-porn/">opinions regarding child porn laws</a>).</p>

<p>The thing is, there are basically no nice people who provide case studies of OPSEC practices. Most are engaged in violence, serious drug trafficking (at the "kill people for interfering" level), theft and manipulation of human beings, etc. Thats the nature of the beast.</p>

<p>People with well funded, trained and motivated adversaries have the strongest incentives to practice the highest level of security. They're the ones to learn from.</p>
