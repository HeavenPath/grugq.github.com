  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Of Bomb Threats and Tor</h2>

<p>Recently (December 16th, 2013) there was a <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/16/unconfirmed-reports-explosives-four-buildings/">bomb threat at Harvard University</a>, during finals week. The threat was a hoax, and the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/17/student-charged-bomb-threat/">FBI got their man</a> that very night. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzt0K7_O4qyqUlEtd2pUWE42amM/edit?usp=sharing">affidavit is here</a>.</p>

<p>This post will look at the tools and techniques the operative used to attempt
to hide his actions, why he failed, and what he should&#8217;ve done to improve his
OPSEC. As a hint: I provided an outline of what he should&#8217;ve done 6 months
ago in <a href="http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/06/13/ignorance-is-strength/">&#8220;<strong>ignorance is strength</strong>&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This post is to outline why OPSEC is so difficult to get right,
even for people who go to Harvard. I am not encouraging any illegal behavior,
but instead analyzing how OPSEC precautions can be so difficult to get right.
Don&#8217;t send bomb threats.</p>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

<ol>
<li>The phases of an operation</li>
<li>Counterintelligence (&#8220;know your enemy&#8221;) as a factor in operational design</li>
<li>Avoid reducing the set of suspects

<ul>
<li>If all students are suspects, all one needs to do is avoid narrowing the pool of potential suspects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h2>Strategic Objectives: Avoid Final Exam</h2>

<p>Strategically, the principal behind this operation (Eldo Kim) was attempting to avoid taking
a Final Exam scheduled for the morning of December 16th. To accomplish his objectives
he designed an operation that would cause an evacuation of the building where he
was to take his final. Rather than recruit an agent
and delegate the execution of the operation, the principal decided to do it himself.</p>

<p>This was not an enlightened decision.</p>

<h2>The Structure of All Things (for values of Things = &#8220;Operations&#8221;)</h2>

<p>All offensive operations share a similar core structure. This structure has been
known for a long time in the military, but is rarely applied in other fields.
Operations have distinct phases that they move through as they progress from vague
idea, to concrete plan, through execution and, finally, onto the escape.</p>

<p>The outline framework for an operation, all of the phases, is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Target Selection</li>
<li>Planning (and Surveillance)</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
<li>Execution</li>
<li>Escape and Evasion</li>
</ol>


<p>This framework is frequently used when dissecting a terrorist attack post mortem,
allowing the security forces to identify the agents involved in each phase. Ideally,
the security forces want to remove the people involved in the <em>Target Selection</em>
and <em>Planning</em> stages. These people tend to be the principals, and are more
valuable than the agents who actually perpetrate the attack.</p>

<p>For hacker groups, the operational phases are rarely acknowledged, and followed
in an ad hoc manner. Primarily because few hackers are aware of them. It would be
beneficial for hackers to understand the structure of preparing an operation
thoroughly, but that is an issue we&#8217;ll address another day.</p>

<p>As an aside, it is worth noting that these operational phases apply to a
consultancy making a sale, providing a service, dropping a deliverable, and then
vanishing. ;)</p>

<h2>College Kids are Inexperienced, News at 11.</h2>

<p>All real criminals know that the most important part of an operation is the
get away, the <em>git</em> (as it used to be called). Of course, real criminals don&#8217;t
go to Harvard University (although there&#8217;s an argument to be made that some
graduate from there), and so poor Eldo Kim had no one to teach him the criticality
of the final stage of an operation: <strong>Escape and Evasion</strong>.</p>

<h2>Operation &#8220;Doomed to Failure&#8221;</h2>

<p>The operative used an ad hoc approach to his operational design, and as a result
he made a fatal error. Here is his operational plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Obtain Tor Browser Bundle</li>
<li>Select target email addresses &#8220;randomly&#8221; [see para 11]</li>
<li>Compose email</li>
<li>For each target email address

<ul>
<li>Create new GuerillaMail &#8220;account&#8221;</li>
<li>Send email (<a href="https://www.guerrillamail.com/compose">using this</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>For security, the operative chose to rely on a pseudonymous email tool and the
Tor anonymity network. He used the Tor Browser Bundle on OSX rather
than the TAILS distribution (see: para 11). Provided he closed the tab between
each session, there should be no forensic evidence left on the laptop.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When using <strong>Tor Browser Bundle</strong> close all the tabs and exit the
application when you are done. The TBB will clean up thoroughly after itself,
<em>but only on exit</em>! When you are done, shut it down. Runa&#8217;s <a href="https://research.torproject.org/techreports/tbb-forensic-analysis-2013-06-28.pdf">paper</a> explores this in
detail.</p>

<h3>Phase 1: Target Selection</h3>

<p>The strategic target was the hall hosting the final exam. Tactically, the
principal selected &#8220;email addresses at random&#8221; to receive a bomb threat intended
to force an evacuation of the hall, along with a number of other cover locations.</p>

<h3>Phase 2: Planning</h3>

<p>This step appears to have been focused solely on the technical requirements of
masking the origination of the threatening emails. However, insufficient resources
were devoted to this phase, and therefore it was fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>Here is the email he sent:</p>

<pre><code>shrapnel bombs placed in: 

science center 
sever hall 
emerson hall 
thayer hall 

2/4. guess correctly. 

be quick for they will go off soon
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly he intended to provide cover locations, and he attempted to prolong the
bomb search by suggesting that some locations where legitimately bomb free. It
is standard operating procedure for bomb threats to be investigated thoroughly
and in parallel.</p>

<h3>Phase 3: Deployment</h3>

<p>The operative chose to use GuerrillaMail to send the emails, and because
GuerrillaMail reveals the source IP of the sender, he also chose Tor to mask his
IP address. However, he used a monitored network to access Tor, which severely
limits the anonymity provided by Tor. This error was to prove fatal.</p>

<h3>Phase 4: Execution</h3>

<p>Kim used the Harvard University wifi network. To gain access, he had to login
with his username and password. The university monitors and logs all network
activity. This was the fatal error. He authenticated to the network, his IP was
used to access Tor, and this information was logged.</p>

<p>When the incident was investigated the FBI was able to pull the logs and determine
not just whether anyone had accessed Tor, but exactly <strong>who</strong> had accessed Tor.</p>

<h3>Phase 5: Escape and Evasion</h3>

<p>There was nothing at all done for this phase. It is worth noting that there is
little he could have done to prepare for an interview by seasoned professional
FBI interrogators. As an amateur, he stood approximately zero chance of surviving.</p>

<h2>Counterintelligence: Know your Adversary</h2>

<p>A study of the investigation methods used by the law enforcement officials
engaged to investigate bomb threats would have been beneficial for Mr Kim. He
would have realized that they would target the likely suspects, attempt to
narrow the suspect pool down to the minimum set, then start interviewing. The
more strongly the evidence points to a set of suspects, the more aggressive the
interviews will be. From &#8220;do you know anything about&#8230;&#8221; to &#8220;We have all the
evidence we need, why don&#8217;t you make it easy for yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Initially the suspects for the case would have been any student scheduled to
take an exam
at one of the targeted halls. This is doubtless a large number, and without any
specific information to go on, the chance of interviewing all of them is slim.
If, however, the FBI did interview all of them, the questioning would be general
and undirected, rather than specific and probing. An amateur, like Kim, who kept
his cool and simply denied any knowledge of the hoax would have had a reasonable
chance of evading suspicion.</p>

<p>Knowing the investigative techniques of his adversary would have allowed Kim to
design an operation that provided for a reliable escape and evasion phase. He
would have used an unmonitored network, in an unmonitored location near by the
school, to send his threats. This would have left the suspect pool extremely
large &#8211; &#8220;everyone&#8221;.</p>

<p>When planning an operation, know how the adversary will respond. This will allow
you to factor that response into your planning. If you do not know how your
adversary will respond, then their response will be a surprise. Do not allow
the reactive force to surprise you.</p>

<h2>There is no OPSEC magic sauce</h2>

<p>The content and context of the threat make it clear
that the originator of the emails was a student (or possibly a professor/TA trying
to avoid grading exams). The important thing to hide is <strong>which</strong> student, not
that it was a student. Therefore simply using a nearby cafe with free wifi should
have been sufficient to mask the specific identity of the operative. Assuming:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are cafes that do not know the operative by sight,</li>
<li>there are cafes that are not monitored by CCTV (wear a hat, don&#8217;t look up),</li>
<li>that he wore a simple disguise to reduce the recall of the witnesses (look generic), and</li>
<li>that a college kid in a cafe at 8am during Finals week is not unusual</li>
</ul>


<p>Using Tor from the college campus was a fatal error. The pool of suspects was
immediately reduced to &#8220;everyone that used Tor during the time the bomb threats
were sent&#8221;. Since Silk Road v1 has been shut down, that is obviously going to be
a small number.</p>

<h2>Lets call it half a win</h2>

<p>Strategically, the operation was successful. Eldo Kim will not have to take his
final exam. Or, indeed, other final exams he might not be prepared for. However,
it is hard to imagine this is the outcome he was hoping for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Survival in an Extremely Adversarial Environment</h1>

<blockquote><p>If your secure communications platform isn&#8217;t being used by terrorists and pedophiles, you&#8217;re probably doing it wrong. &#8211; [REDACTED]</p></blockquote>

<p>A few years ago a group of child pornographers was infiltrated by police who were
able to monitor, interact, and aggressively investigate the members. Despite
engaging in a 15 month undercover operation, only one in three of the pedophiles
were successfully apprehended. The majority, including the now infamous leader
<em>Yardbird</em>, escaped capture. The dismal success rate of the law enforcement
officials was due entirely to the strict security rules followed by the group.</p>

<p>This post will examine those rules, the reasons for their success, and the
problems the group faced which necessitated those rules.</p>

<p>(An examination of the group&#8217;s security from a slightly different perspective
was conducted by <code>Baal</code> and is available <a href="http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html">here</a>)</p>

<h2>Covert Organizations, Seen One, Seen &#8216;em All</h2>

<p>All covert organizations face a similar set of problems as they attempt to execute
on their fundamental mission &#8211; to <strong>continue to exist</strong>. A covert organization
in an adversarial environment faces a number of organizational challenges and
constraints. Fundamentally how it handles trade-offs between operational
security and efficiency mandates how group members perform their operational
activities. Strong OPSEC means low efficiency, while high efficiency necessitates
weak OPSEC. The strength of the oppositional forces dictate the minimum security
requirements of the covert organization.</p>

<p>Examining the operational activities &#8211; those actions the organization must engage
in to self perpetuate &#8211; allows us to evaluate their operational security decisions
within their environmental context.</p>

<h3>Operational Activities:</h3>

<p>The <em>Yardbird</em> child abuse content group (hereafter also called the <em>enterprise</em>)
had a number of core goals that had to be addressed to continue operation: they
needed to distribute their child abuse content to members; communicate between
members; raise funds to acquire new content; recruit new members (presumably for
access to additional child abuse content).</p>

<p>Explicitly stated, this is an enumerated list of the operational activities that
the group <strong>had</strong> to engage in to self perpetuate.</p>

<ol>
<li>Distribution of Child Abuse Content</li>
<li>Communication and Coordinate Action</li>
<li>Fund raising</li>
<li>Recruitment and Vetting</li>
</ol>


<p>Except for the first issue (strategically significant only to this group),
these are pretty typical activities for a clandestine organization. Besides their
defining operational activity, they need a communications channel, fund raising
capability, and membership management processes.</p>

<h2>Opposition Success: The Penetration</h2>

<p>The law enforcement authorities caught a pedophile distribution child abuse
content. He is a member of the <em>Yardbird</em> group and offers up complete access
to the group, along with archival logs, in exchange for leniency.</p>

<p>All of the information about this group comes from the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzt0K7_O4qyqMi0ycjZFdzhxYTA/edit?usp=sharing">Castleman Affidavit</a>,
the <code>Baal</code> <a href="http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html">analysis</a>, and some <code>Baal</code> <a href="http://alt.privacy.anon-server.narkive.com/VRl3dTFH/the-fourth-of-yardbird-s-chums-grabs-his-ankles">follow ups</a>.</p>

<h2>A Frustrating Infiltration</h2>

<p>The law enforcement authorities were about to completely penetrate the <em>enterprise</em>
for a 15 month period from 2006-08-31 through 2007-12-15. During that time the
group&#8217;s posted 400,000 images and 1,1000 videos. The <em>enterprise</em> had approximately
45 active members, although <a href="http://alt.privacy.anon-server.narkive.com/VRl3dTFH/the-fourth-of-yardbird-s-chums-grabs-his-ankles">independent observers</a> have claimed this is low with
the real membership anywhere from 48 to 61.</p>

<p>The total number of arrests was 14, or somewhere around 1/3rd. A fully staffed,
highly motivated, well trained adversarial force with complete penetration of
a large complacent group was only about to achieve a one in three success rate.
The majority of those successes were achieved due to group members being insufficiently
cautious and violating the <em>enterprise</em> security rules. Obviously, these security
rules are extremely resilient against adversarial assault.</p>

<p>The members who were caught were those who violated the security SOP of the group:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accessing a newsgroup server without using Tor (e.g. VPN, or directly)</li>
<li>Revealing personal details about themselves</li>
<li>Contacting each other outside the group&#8217;s secure comms channel</li>
</ul>


<h2>Operational Activity: Distribution</h2>

<p>The <em>enterprise</em> was careful to ensure that the location of the encrypted files
containing child abuse images was a different newsgroup from the communications
newsgroup. One possible reason is to unlink the obvious encrypted group discussion
from the larger encrypted content posts. That is, they compartmented their
commo from their file sharing. As an additional, although superfluous step, the
<em>enterprise</em> would apparently alter the sequence number of the split binary
uploads so that reassembly would be hampered. What this cumbersome step added
beyond the existing PGP encryption is unclear (if your adversary can break PGP
they can probably figure out the order some files).</p>

<h2>Operational Activity: Communications</h2>

<p>The <em>enterprise</em> would use the primary newsgroup, at the start of the investigation
<code>alt.anonymous.messages</code>, to announce the location of a media cache for group
members. The communications newsgroup is always reserved strictly for communications.
The announcements regarding new downloads provided detailed instructions as to
the location of the child abuse content, plus how to download, assemble and decrypt it.</p>

<p>The group used a single shared PGP key for all members. On the one hand, this
would completely negate the security provided by PGP if the key falls into the
wrong hands. It also limits the groups ability to expel a member who transgresses
the rules and needs to be punished. On the other hand, the use of a shared key
makes key management significantly easier which is a serious concern when you
need to rekey every few months. Additionally, using only one key reduces the
ability of the adversary to determine group size by examining the PGP packets.
It also removes the potential for a group member to reuse a key that is linked
to their real identity. See <a href="http://ritter.vg/blog-deanonymizing_amm.html">this excellent</a> presentation for more details on those attacks.</p>

<h2>Operational Activity: Recruitment</h2>

<p>The <em>enterprise</em> expanded by allowing new members to join. There were clear
guidelines, procedures and rules for expansion. First there was a background
check to ensure that the prospective member was an established and active
participant in the wider community of child abuse image traders. Then an existing
member has to invite the prospect to the group. Finally, to demonstrate both
their deep involvement in the activity and to prove they are not an undercover
cop, they must pass a timed written test on the minutiae of various child abuse
victims and media.</p>

<h3>Vetting</h3>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate active participation in the &#8220;trading scene&#8221;</li>
<li>Invited by existing member</li>
<li>Must exhibit deep domain specific knowledge via timed written test</li>
</ul>


<h2>Security Rules that Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Never reveal true identity to another member of the group</li>
<li>Never communicate with another member of the group outside the usenet channel</li>
<li>Group membership remains strictly within the confines of the Internet

<ul>
<li>No member can positively identify another</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Members do not reveal personally identifying information</li>
<li>Primary communications newsgroup is migrated regularly

<ul>
<li>If a member violates a security rule, e.g. fails to encrypt a message</li>
<li>Periodically to reduce chance of law enforcement discovery</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On each <strong>newsgroup migration</strong>

<ul>
<li>Create new PGP key pair, unlinking from previous messages</li>
<li>Each member creates a new nickname

<ul>
<li>Nickname theme selected by <em>Yardbird</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Root of Success</h2>

<p>The reason the majority of the group was able to avoid capture was in a small way
due to the technology they were using (Tor), but primarily it was adherence to the
security rules of the group. They had very good OPSEC and they followed it
consistently. Fundamentally, they had complete compartmentation within the group
&#8211; they did not reveal information to each other. The
law enforcement authorities were able to get logs of all their communications
traffic, plus logs of their IP addresses they used for posting. Everyone that
used Tor (as per the recommendation of <em>Yardbird</em>) was anonymous at the IP
layer. This protected them from a subpoena revealing their identity. As long as
there was no additional information that they had revealed about themselves in
their messages, they were secure against the opposition.</p>

<p>The use of PGP was essentially a No-OP in this case. It excluded the general
public from accessing the content of the communications traffic (and the child
abuse videos and images). It did not protect the traffic against analysis by the
opposition (who had successfully infiltrated the group). The encryption was not
a factor in their successful evasion. Rather, it was the content of the messages,
controlled and dictated by the security rules, which protected their secrets.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Guarding secrets involves not sharing them. Encryption can only ever protect the
content of a communique. Real security must start with the content itself, and
then use encryption as an additional layer.</p>

<h3>Note from the Editor</h3>

<p>(Feel free to skip this part if you don&#8217;t think studying how child pornographers
avoid capture is relevant)</p>

<p>When analyzing the activities of groups operating in an adversarial environment to learn what works, what doesn&#8217;t, and why, (unfortunately) the pool of covert organisations is somewhat limited: intelligence agencies; terrorist groups; hacker crews; narcos; insurgents; child pornographers&#8230; Few other groups face such a hostile operating environment that their security measures are really &#8220;tested&#8221;.</p>

<p>The group examined in this post had an incredibly effective set of security practices. They imposed strict compartmentation, regularly migrated identities and locations, required consistent Tor and PGP use, etc. They had legitimate punishments for people who transgressed the rules (expulsion) and they survived a massive investigation effort. Clearly, they were doing something right (actually a number of things).
Just as clearly, they are reprehensible people who engage in activity that is immoral and unethical, by any measure. (Paying for child pornography to be produced is flat out wrong, regardless on where you stand on the spectrum of <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2012/05/23/cynicism-redefined-why-the-copyright-lobby-loves-child-porn/">opinions regarding child porn laws</a>).</p>

<p>The thing is, there are basically no nice people who provide case studies of OPSEC practices. Most are engaged in violence, serious drug trafficking (at the &#8220;kill people for interfering&#8221; level), theft and manipulation of human beings, etc. Thats the nature of the beast.</p>

<p>People with well funded, trained and motivated adversaries have the strongest incentives to practice the highest level of security. They&#8217;re the ones to learn from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Everybody Was Hack Foo Fighting</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m going to discuss a serious problem with the organisational structure and
social dynamics of the hacker community, and why this puts hackers at risk.
Hackers operate essentially the same way as the henchmen in a kung fu movie:
they attack the adversary one by one by one&#8230; always losing. This is a terrible
way of developing a robust core of knowledge about which OPSEC techniques work,
which techniques fail, and why.</p>

<h2>Organisational Learning for Dummies</h2>

<p>There are two types of knowledge: individual, and organisational. Hackers are
very individualistic, and the knowledge they acquire tends to be very
practical; experience based. There are few hacker organisations that seek to
collect, retain, test and spread knowledge. The organistations that do crop up
are either some zines, which are knowledge artefacts that transmit techne, or
hacker groups, which share tool chains and experience. However, these hacker
groups have very short lifespans (measured in months and single digit years,
not decades). They are compartmented in that there is some effort made to
retain the group&#8217;s proprietary information, but internally they usually
have a very poor security posture. They are social groups in many ways, so
they are heavily compromised. As we say in infosec &#8220;crunchy on the outside,
chewy in the middle&#8221;.</p>

<p>Their opposition, the intelligence agencies and law enforcement departments,
have decades of organisational history and knowledge. The individual members
can display wide ranges of skill and competence, but the resources and core
knowledge of the organisation dwarf what any individual hacker has available.
Many of the skills that a hacker needs to learn, his clandestine tradecraft
and OPSEC, are the sort of skills that organisations are excellent at
developing and disseminating. These are not very good skillsets for an
individual to learn through trial and error, because those errors have
significant negative consequences. An organisation can afford to lose people
as it learns how to deal with the adversary; an individual cannot afford to
make a similar sacrifice &#8211; afterall, who would benefit from your negative
example?</p>

<h2>Challenges? More Like Opportunities!</h2>

<p>Hackers are facing some very serious challenges now:</p>

<ul>
<li>they lack organistations for collecting intelligence and knowledge about their adversary;</li>
<li>they face off against the adversary one at a time,</li>
<li>they learn very poorly from prior mistakes</li>
<li>they don&#8217;t even know what skills they need,</li>
<li>and perhaps most dangerously, they aren&#8217;t even aware they&#8217;re in the game</li>
</ul>


<p>It is amusing how many people think that interrogations involve violence and
torture. Successful elicitation far more frequently involves whiskey,
flattery, playing dumb, and being doubtful (&#8221;<em>really? I didn&#8217;t know it was
possible to do that. You must be pretty damn smart to have figured it
out&#8230;</em>&#8221;).</p>

<h2>Winning at Secrets</h2>

<p>There needs to be more information available on the techniques used during
investigations, as well as before they begin. There needs to be documentation
on how to evade those techniques, and why those evasions are successful. That
knowledge needs to be captured and dissemminated out to those who can use it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>25th Anniversary of STFU about your computer crimes</h2>

<p>Reading <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/05/heres-what-the-morris-worm-prosecutor-thinks-about-aaron-swartz/">this interview</a> with the prosecutor of Robert Morris Jr about the Morris Worm there are a few cool OPSEC lessons we can learn.</p>

<h2>How was Morris caught?</h2>

<blockquote><p>One way was with computer forensics. Tracing back the source of the worm. The second way was one of Morris&#8217;s friends told The New York Times in response to some articles that John Markoff was writing he inadvertently gave his initials.</p></blockquote>

<p>There were a couple of ways that he was discovered. The first was the forensic analysis of the worm itself, and tracing that back to the original infection point. This sort of evidence shows where to look (the original infection), but it does not provide enough information to successfully prosecute. It is circumstantial so far, and given some careful sanitisation of the original box, it would be a very hard case to prove.</p>

<p>The far more damaging way that Morris was caught was via an OSINT case officer doing HUMINT collection (a reporter interviewing people about the worm). The journo managed to elicit information about the worm&#8217;s author (his initials). This is the sort of extremely damaging information leakage that happens when there is poor OPSEC. There was no anti-interrogation training provided to the members of the Morris cell (i.e. all his friends who knew about the development of the worm).</p>

<h2>Deny everything. Admit nothing. Or, you know, not.</h2>

<blockquote><p>he did testify that he wrote the worm. He came in and testified, &#8220;I did it, and I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; I turned to my co-counsel and asked, &#8220;Should I prove he didn&#8217;t do it or he&#8217;s not sorry?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>When the prosecution has to prove that you committed a felonious act, it is a lot easier for them when you <strong>confess</strong> on the stand. I can&#8217;t second guess the decisions of Morris&#8217; legal counsel, but unless you are instructed to do so by your lawyer: STFU.</p>

<h2>The Morris Cell and &#8220;Need to know&#8221;</h2>

<blockquote><p>We talked to his friends. His friends were witnesses for us. They didn&#8217;t have a choice.
There was a core group. &#8230;one of the meetings where Robert Morris was discussing the worm occurred at a Legal Seafood in Kendall Square&#8230;
He talked about how it was developed, how it worked, what vulnerabilities it exploited. At one point he was at a meeting back at Harvard, he got so excited that he literally jumped up on a table pacing back and forth on the table explaining how it worked&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>The close friends of Robert Morris, the Morris Cell, were fully briefed on all aspects of the worm. Its capabilities, its functionality, and its author&#8217;s real identity. None of the other members of the cell were actively exposed to the risks of the operation. They had no &#8220;need to know&#8221;.</p>

<p>This failure to STFU, to properly compartment the design and development of the worm, was a key factor leading to his capture and prosecution. Fortunately, things worked out well for him, in the long run.</p>

<h2>How to evaluate &#8220;Need to know&#8221;</h2>

<p>The rule of thumb is: <em>if someone is actively sharing the risk, they have a need to know</em>. This need to know is, of course, restricted to only those aspects of the operation in which they are actively involved.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>OPSEC revisited</h2>

<blockquote><p>The goal of OPSEC is to control information about your capabilities and intentions to keep them from being exploited by your adversary.</p></blockquote>

<p>In typical hacker fashion, the term OPSEC has come to mean more than just information about capabilities and intentions, but also personal information about the yourself.</p>

<h2>Kerckoff&#8217;s Principle and OPSEC</h2>

<p>A common source for the idea that &#8220;security through obscurity is bad&#8221; is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27_principle">Kerckoffs&#8217; principle</a> which states that: <code>A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge</code>. OPSEC as a system of security is sometimes confused with &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221;. This is not the case. Such thinking reflects a confusion of both the problem with opaque security systems and the foundations of OPSEC.</p>

<h2>OPSEC is a System</h2>

<p>The way to clear this confusion, I believe, is to point out that OPSEC is a security system, not any one specific practice. The system itself is open source, in that we know how and why the various techniques and practices work. For example, the tradecraft technique of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_drop">dead drop</a> is public knowledge. The security of a dead drop is not that no one knows how they work, but rather the adversary does not know <strong>where</strong> a specific dead drop is locate, nor <strong>when</strong> that dead drop is being serviced (loaded or unload). That information, primarily the location of that dead drop, is the <strong>secret key</strong> to the dead drop security system. This information is what must remain secret for the dead drop to remain secure.</p>

<h2>Why OPSEC Works</h2>

<p>So OPSEC as a system of security does not violate Kerckoff&#8217;s principle, and is not &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221;. The specifics of any one application of OPSEC techniques provide security, but those are analogous to the private key to the system. If they are compromised, then security they provide will be be compromised.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Briefly, I would like to highlight some important considerations for good OPSEC. Firstly, OPSEC is a mode of operating, not a tool or a collection of tools. Secondly, OPSEC comes at a cost, and a significant part of that cost is efficiency. OPSEC is slow. Finally, maintaining a strong security posture (i.e. “good OPSEC”) for long periods of time is very stressful, even for professionally trained espionage officers.</p>

<p>Learning good OPSEC requires internalizing the behavioural changes required to continually maintain a strong security posture. The operational activities have to become habit, because the small things matter, and every careless mistake can compromise security. The only way to develop good OPSEC habits, good security hygiene, is to practice. Make the foolish beginners mistakes during a practice session, rather than in the field. Two relevant sayings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amateurs practice until they get it right, professionals practice until they can’t get it wrong</li>
<li>The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war</li>
</ul>


<p>After developing good security hygiene habits, the second most difficult thing about good OPSEC is learning patience. Increased OPSEC security comes at the cost of efficiency, primarily in communication time-frames. The OPSEC mechanisms that must be in place to reduce the risks during communication add latency. As a result, communication takes significantly longer and is less reliable. Obviously, this is more of an issue with time sensitive operations than those that have more generous deadlines.</p>

<p>The single greatest security risk is communication between operatives. Clandestine agencies, such as the CIA, MI6, DGSE, etc. will work incredibly hard to minimize the risks surrounding communication with their recruited agents. In the simplest form, this involves a 2-4 hour “surveillance detection route” (SDR) to see if they are “in the black” before they perform any operational activity. This is on top of the hours of planning for the operation itself (note: these are minimums, operations requiring high security might take weeks or months of planning, and 12 hour SDRs).</p>

<p>The technology that exists to facilitate information security, e.g. encryption, is important, but it is not sufficient or even the starting point for robust OPSEC. By all means, learn to use encryption software correctly and in a properly secure fashion. However, it is more important to compartment sensitive activities and structure your operational environment for impact containment than
install use particular software.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Counterintelligence Lessons for Drug Dealers</h2>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Events have overtaken my slow writing speed. This post was in the works
before the Silk Road bust in September 2013. I&#8217;m uploading it anyway because it
has some useful information, however there seems little point in finish it now.</p>

<p>The dealers on Silk Road ship a large amount of illegal products around the world, and it is clear that they&#8217;re successful at it. However, the US Postal service has been aware that drug dealers user their service for shipping illegal substances and has developed guidelines for determining suspect packages efficiently. Unfortunately for them, those guidelines have leaked and this allows someone abusing the US mail as an illicit distribution channel to evade the USP&#8217;s checks.</p>

<h2>Suspicious Post Guidelines</h2>

<p>The actual <a href="http://teknopolitik.tumblr.com/post/48178417204/fbi-law-enforcement-bulletin-via-findarticles">guidelines for suspicious packages</a> list a number of major indicators that the inspectors look for. This guide is somewhat outdated, and a <a href="http://www.orlandocriminaldefenseattorneyblog.com/2012/05/drug-trafficking-via-express-m.html">revised version</a> has also be leaked. In both cases, the <strong>triggers</strong> and the reasoning behind them are similar.</p>

<h3>FBI Profiling Criteria</h3>

<ol>
<li>Heavy taping along the seams;</li>
<li>poor preparation for mailing;</li>
<li>uneven weight distribution;</li>
<li>apparent package reuse; and</li>
<li>labels that are handwritten, contain misspellings, originate from a drug-source State, indicate person-to-person not business-to-individual mail, have a return zip code that does not match the accepting post office zip code, a fictitious return address, names of senders or recipients with features in common (John Smith, e.g.) and having no connection to either address</li>
</ol>


<h3>Drug Mail Profile</h3>

<ol>
<li>the use of Express Mail,

<ul>
<li>Express Mail is primarily used by businesses for document delivery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the weight of the package,

<ul>
<li>drug traffickers are mailing approximately one kilo of cocaine per package, plus some dummy weights</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the package is sent from Puerto Rico, a known drug source location,</li>
<li>the package was mailed from a post office address outside of the zip code on the return address,</li>
<li>an Accurint check reveals that no one by the sender&#8217;s name lived at the return address,

<ul>
<li>Police will also check Google and Facebook to get more information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the package is heavily taped at all seams

<ul>
<li>heavy taping may or may not help evade detection by drug sniffing dogs&#8211;but we know one thing for sure&#8211;it certainly helps draw police attention to the package!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the label is handwritten

<ul>
<li>Since most Express Mail is business-to-business, or business-to-client, labels that aren&#8217;t typed are suspect</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Collated</h3>

<p>Anything that looks like someone is sending slightly over an even metric weight of <em>something</em>, from a known suspect location, to another person, in an old heavily taped package with a fake return address. Sounds like bad tradecraft.</p>

<ol>
<li>Suspicious packaging

<ul>
<li>Heavy taping</li>
<li>Package reuse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not business mail

<ul>
<li>No printed label</li>
<li>Clearly not documents</li>
<li>Individual to individual</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Known suspicious origin

<ul>
<li>Occasionally specific post offices</li>
<li>Specific countries (Puerto Rico)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flimsy &#8220;return address&#8221; cover

<ul>
<li>Fake name</li>
<li>Mismatched name + address</li>
<li>Mismatched address + zipcode</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Main points to take away:</p>

<ul>
<li>drug packages appear different from normal mail</li>
<li>many factors are contribute to creating a plausible cover/alias.</li>
<li>The packaging of a drug shipment provides a cover, which needs to be backstopped.</li>
</ul>


<p>Don&#8217;t make shit up, do your research and steal an identity with a real address.</p>

<h2>Backstop your cover</h2>

<p>When creating a cover, make sure it is as fully fleshed out as possible. This means developing supporting evidence to bolster the validity of the cover. In intelligence lingo, this is called backstopping.</p>

<p>A backstopped cover is one where checks to verify the authenticity of the cover story are verifiable. For example, if the cover story includes a name, there are matching identity documents; if there is an phone number, it connects to someone who will substantiate the cover story; if there is an address, it exists. The old Soviet illegals used to spend years developing their cover and backstopping them. They&#8217;d live for a few years in a country they claimed to be immigrating from, so they would have the memories, experience and verifiable evidence that they were from there.</p>

<p>If you are going to use a cover (you probably should), then put in the effort to create a backstop. The complexity and depth of that backstop are dependant on how deeply the cover will be investigated. Remember though, it is better to have too much, than not enough&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Give it to me straight, dr the grugq</h2>

<p>Generally, it appears that Ross Ulbricht was applying his economic and
techno-libertarian philosophy to real life. As his project grew, his security
posture improved &#8211; too late. The most serious mistakes that Ross Ulbricht made
were made during the period Jan 2011 - Oct 2011. A full timeline of the events
in the Complaint is available on <a href="http://grugq.tumblr.com/post/62914009002/silk-road-investigation-timeline">my tumblr</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is an abridged version of a longer post pulling out the lessons learned
from the <a href="http://grugq.tumblr.com/post/62909883417/ulricht-indictment-aka-dread-pirate-roberts-aka-silk">Silk Road Complaint</a> of 27th September 2013. This post will only list the OPSEC errors,
rather than explore them in detail.</p>

<h2>The OPSEC Failures</h2>

<p>The fundamental error is poor compartmentation. Ross Ulbricht, the real person
and the online persona (Google+, LinkedIn, etc), and the Dread Pirate Roberts
persona share ideological views and geographic locations. There is contamination
between the two personas. Most of these seem to be due to the organic evolution
of the Silk Road venture, where early naive Ulbricht makes mistakes that later
smarter DPR wouldn&#8217;t. Unfortunately, the later DPR is more ideologically
extreme and consequently less savvy about mainstream society.</p>

<ol>
<li>Poor Compartmentation</li>
<li>Profiling</li>
<li>Geographic Location</li>
<li>Isolation</li>
</ol>


<h3>Poor Compartmentation</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Contamination</strong>: seriously fatal links created between personas

<ul>
<li><strong>Silk Road</strong> + <strong>altoid</strong>: Shroomery, BitcoinTalk forums</li>
<li><strong>altoid</strong> + <strong>rossulbricht@gmail.com</strong>: BitcoinTalk</li>
<li><strong>Ross Ulbricht</strong> + <strong>frosty@frosty[.com]</strong>: StackOverflow</li>
<li><strong>frosty@frosty</strong> + <strong>Silk Road</strong>: Silk Road server admin SSH key</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The compartmentation failures are somewhat pervasive, in particular the ideological
&#8220;Austrian School of Economics&#8221; and the mises.org site. However two particular
contamination errors stand out:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Silk Road</strong> &#8211;> <strong>altoid</strong> &#8211;> <strong>rossulbricht@gmail.com</strong> link in 2011</li>
<li><strong>Ross Ulbricht</strong> &#8211;> <strong>frosty@frosty.com</strong> &#8211;> <strong>Silk Road</strong> server link in 2013</li>
</ol>


<p>The first of these failures happened because the <strong>altoid</strong> persona used to
promoted <strong>Silk Road</strong> was poorly fleshed out (e.g. no email address). Ross did not
put the plumbing in place to backstop his <strong>altoid</strong> cover. He then joined the
BitcoinTalk community using this contaminated cover. His participation and search
for social validation left him with his guard down. Consequently, he revealed a
great deal of profiling information about his project and beliefs. Many of his
posts are about Silk Road infrastructure or his mises.org influenced economic
theories. After participating for 10 months he finally made the
<strong>fatal OPSEC error</strong> of posting his personal email address.</p>

<p>The second error was poor compartmentation of his online Ross Ulbricht persona,
the tech savvy San Francisco based startup guy, and &#8220;frosty&#8221; the system admin
of the server hosting the Silk Road site. His poor compartmentation, likely
using the same computer for both personal and business use, and his
limited backstopping of the DPR/altoid/frosty persona meant that any error would be
fatal.</p>

<p>These two errors combine to link Silk Road with Ross Ulbricht, and Ross Ulbricht
with Silk Road.</p>

<h3>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take Profiles for $300, Alex&#8221; : &#8220;Too much in common&#8221; : &#8220;What do Ulbricht and DPR share?&#8221;</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Profiling</strong>: Ross Ulbricht talks and acts like Dread Pirate Roberts

<ul>
<li>LinkedIn profile</li>
<li>Timezone leakage: private messages, <a href="http://media.encrypted.cc/files/dpr_posts_pdt.png">forum posting times</a></li>
<li>BitcoinTalk <strong>altoid</strong> <a href="http://grugq.tumblr.com/post/62919678278/osint-case-study-ross-ulbricht-aka-dread-pirate">posts about</a>: economics (mises.org), security, programming</li>
<li>Silk Road Forum <strong>Dread Pirate Roberts</strong> -> Mises + &#8220;Austrian School of Economics&#8221;</li>
<li>Mises.org <strong>Ross Ulbricht</strong> account</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Ross Ulbricht, the person, was an active participant in the mises.org website
and the BitcoinTalk forums. In both cases he was deeply committed to the
&#8220;Austrian School of Economics&#8221;, something the Dread Pirate Roberts was also a
huge fan of. The <strong>altoid</strong> cover alias, linked directly to Ross Ulbricht,
frequently talked about bitcoin security and PHP programming. He is, based on
his posts, clearly invovled in running some sort of PHP based bitcoin using
venture that requires high security. Sort of like the <strong>Silk Road</strong> site.</p>

<ul>
<li>Geographic Location

<ul>
<li>Silk Road web server administered over VPN from a server</li>
<li>VPN server IP stored in the Silk Road PHP source code</li>
<li>VPN server accessed from a location <code>15240 cm</code> (<code>500 ft</code>) from a location that accessed the Ross Ulbricht GMail account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The location of the Dread Pirate Roberts was something of an open secret. It is
clear that he was based in the west coast of the US. Ulbricht was located
in San Francisco at the same time as DPR, as proved by his large online
footprint: Google+, YouTube, GMail.</p>

<h2>Isolation is bad, mmmkay</h2>

<ul>
<li>Isolation without relief

<ul>
<li>Rented room under assumed name</li>
<li>No &#8220;mainstream&#8221; social circle to realign with social mores</li>
<li>No peers to talk to, only Silk Road forum members and admins</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>After the <strong>altoid</strong> persona is retired from BitcoinTalk, Ulbricht migrates
his social interaction to a more extreme community: the Silk Road forums. This
appears to have been his &#8220;scene&#8221;, where he interacted with people and
cultivated friends (including an impressive array of undercover law
enforcement officials).</p>

<p>The underground life forced on Ulbricht as the Dread Pirate Roberts led to
the major problem of isolation. Human beings are social animals. We require
social interaction to maintain a healthy mental state. The strict
security of DPR required isolation, leaving Ross Ulbricht living his social
life on forums with niche ideological views, initially BitcointTalk (in 2011)
and then the Silk Road forums. Isolation from mainstream society is known to
lead to ideological extremism as members of the niche community self-reinforce
their ideological tendencies. Consequently, they are less able to understand
mainstream society&#8217;s ideas, beliefs and morals. This is dangerous. This
isolation leads him to rationalize hiring online hitmen to preserve the
Silk Road community is morally acceptable.</p>

<p>Apparently the only source of social validation and ego gratification that Ross
had was a group of bitcoin libertarians, drug seekers, drug dealers and undercover
cops. This is not a healthy social environment conducive to a balanced state of
mental health.</p>

<h2>What have we learned?</h2>

<p>So, the Dread Pirate Roberts Complaint basically tells us nothing that we didn&#8217;t
already <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/grugq/opsec-for-hackers">know about OPSEC</a>.
There are some lessons learned which can be used to harden OPSEC practices going
forward. The main things are still: strong compartmentation; use Tor
all the time; avoid leaking profiling information, and it is prudent to
regularly migrate to new cover personas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some interesting lessons on how a modern New York City drug delivery service
uses basic tradecraft to create a reasonable security posture.</p>

<h2>The Source</h2>

<p>This <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/confessions-of-a-drug-dealers-delivery-service-guy">Vice article</a>
provides the source of the information for this blog post. Using some
basic background knowledge on how covert groups operate, it is simple to parse
and analyze the drug delivery service tradecraft.</p>

<h2>Recruitment</h2>

<blockquote><p>a friend of mine solicited hardcore drugs for a Manhattan drug kingpin, who was looking for a new pot delivery guy. My friend encouraged me to try out for the job.</p></blockquote>

<p>As with many covert groups, the recruitment process relied on personal connections.
This <strong>social network</strong> grounded approach to expanding a covert organisation
is generally good for initial security. The recruits are unlikely to be agents
sent to infiltrate the organistation as the long standing social ties between
members and recruits both establishes trust and serves as <strong>vetting</strong>.</p>

<p>Developing a covert organisation based on <strong>social network</strong> ties provides a
means of rapid expansion and easy security clearance. The downside is that once
a single member of the organisation is compromised, the adversarial security forces
can easily roll up the whole network. The poor compartmentation of a <strong>social network</strong>
based covert organisation is its Achilles heel. The security of the organisation
is critically dependent on the security of each individual member.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> Expand your covert network with individuals who are passionate about
your ideological beliefs. Ensure strong compartmentation, starting with recruitment.</p>

<h2>Leverage</h2>

<blockquote><p>He asked me to provide documentation of my current address and phone number as an insurance policy. If I ran out on him, he warned me he’d hold my friends responsible for the deficit funds and/or drugs.</p></blockquote>

<p>The principal of the organisation &#8220;Nathan&#8221; requires that the recruit provide
a verifiable address and means of contact, along with dire warnings of consequences
in the case of infractions. This is very basic control principles, typical of
covert organisations.</p>

<p>The major security problem with this approach, of course, is that the records
maintained by the network&#8217;s principal are a high value target for the adversary.
Compromise of the principal&#8217;s records will lead to total collapse of the network,
and interdiction for every member involved. There is no chance of evasion.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> No logs, no crime. Do not keep records of the members of your covert
organisation. These records are extremely sensitive.</p>

<h2>Operational Actions</h2>

<blockquote><p> the transaction and exit should be as swift as possible. “You aren&#8217;t here to hang out,” she said. “It&#8217;s not a social call, and they aren&#8217;t your friends. You want to walk in and be friendly and make conversation but also get to the business at hand and get out of there quickly.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The illicit operation, the drug sale, is intended to be rapid and minimize
the period of vulnerability for both parties. Interestingly, this is possibly a
poor choice if the threat is surveillance. There are few reasons a random individual
would enter a domicile for a short duration. Also of note, the covert organisation
provides no reasonable cover story for why the agent (the drug courier) is entering
the residence of the client. A simple &#8220;what were you doing?&#8221; type question would
likely completely blow the whole operation.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> Minimising the period of vulnerability improves the chances of operational
success. Always make sure your agents are capable of delivering plausible cover
stories. <strong>Cover for action</strong></p>

<h2>Cover for Status</h2>

<blockquote><p>Nathan forced me to wear a button-up shirt and slacks, shave my face, and keep my hair conservatively short. He believed this uniform would attract little attention as I walked around with thousands of dollars worth of pot in a laptop case slung over my shoulder.</p></blockquote>

<p>The covert organisation has, surprisingly enough, chosen to enforce a uniform
that makes their agents blend in with the mainstream. This is completely inline
with the typical operational disguises employed by covert organistations operating
in controlled territory the world over. (See: Moscow Rules <code>go with the flow</code>;
Murphy&#8217;s Laws of War: <code>don't stand out, it draws fire</code>)</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> They got this one exactly right.</p>

<h2>All phones are bugged</h2>

<blockquote><p>Although I used my flip-phone constantly at work, I was never given clients&#8217; addresses over the phone. Clients calls would go to a dispatcher—a third party who took the call, traced the number through a database of numbers, and then returned the call from a different phone to confirm their request for drugs. After their request was confirmed, I received a call from another phone. The dispatcher only told me, “You got Nick,” or “You got Lucy.” I was banned from responding with anything besides a murmured “OK.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Each operational use of the phone provides the adversary with minimal value.
There is a unique identifier for the client (e.g. &#8220;Lucy&#8221;), and the agent
acknowledges receipt of the directive (&#8220;OK&#8221;). The dispatchers interaction
with the client is itself run over multiple phone lines and kept to short,
simple, normal statements.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> This is very much inline with all covert organisations&#8217;
guidelines for using phones. Never use keywords, keep the content as vague as possible,
minimize the period of vulnerability &#8211; get off the phone!</p>

<h2>OPSEC FAIL: attracting attention</h2>

<blockquote><p>Each day I was given a stipend of $40 for cabs. No one knew if I didn’t spend the $40. Instead of taking cabs, I ran around in a frantic state that negated every other measure I took to not draw unwanted attention</p></blockquote>

<p>This is an instance of <strong>preference divergence</strong>, a common problem for covert
organisations. The financial resources provided to the agent of the principal
are siphoned off and directed towards non-operational uses (the drug courier
skims and pockets his cab stipend.) There doesn&#8217;t appear to be any consequence
to this operational security failure, however it jeopardizes the entire organisation.
If &#8220;Nathan&#8221; were a more disciplined principal he would monitor his agents more
closely and ensure they are conforming to the organisational security requirements.
Strangely, drug dealers are not strict disciplinarians.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> if the securit of the entire organisation is dependent on the security
of each individual agent &#8211; enforce the operational security requirements strictly!</p>

<h2>Aliases</h2>

<blockquote><p> I shook his hand and said, “I&#8217;m Jack.” He gave me a knowing grin. “So that&#8217;s the name you&#8217;re using?” he asked.</p></blockquote>

<p>The agent is using an alias to provide pseudonymity from malicious clients. This
provides some minimal level of security. It is definitely better than not having
any cover at all. However, as noted above, it should be combined with a robust
cover story for why the agent is visiting a residential home for a brief period.</p>

<h2>Discharging the agent</h2>

<p>After a promotion, the drug courier decides to find a new line of work. If the
organisation was stricter in their OPSEC practices, the departure of an agent
wouldn&#8217;t place anyone else in jeopardy. As it stands, it seems clear that the
agent who is now drawing attention to himself by writing about his experience
in a national magazine(!) still retains sufficiently sensitive information to
unravel the network.</p>

<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> compartment early, compartment often. It is safer than any alternative.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Compartment your covert organisation from recruitment through to operational
action so that when your agents leave or are compromised they are unable
to compromise the organisation. Ensure that your operational activities have
good <strong>cover for status</strong> (e.g. a disguise) and <strong>cover for action</strong> (e.g. a strong cover story).
Strong compartmentation, strong cover, and be aware of the risks of using social networks
for building a covert organisation.</p>
