<p><b>An Analysis of Al-Qaida Tradecraft</b> is the 'companion document'
to DSSi's <b>Hunting the Sleepers</b>:

</p><p>This analysis of what is portrayed as Al-Qaida's tradecraft will be
largely parenthetical; it is based on the HTML document made possible by
John Young's Cryptome effort, and the original (unedited, uncommented,
unredacted) is available at:
</p><p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020414171736/http://cryptome.org/alq-terr-man.htm">http://cryptome.org/alq-terr-man.htm</a>
</p><p>Comments on the text will be contained within brackets and italicized
[<i>as such</i>] so they can be distinguished from the original text and
Cryptome comments.
</p><p>The analysis of this tradecraft has, as its primary focus, the identification
of 'sleeper' (covert) operators so that they can be neutralized; please
see DSSi's <b>Hunting the Sleepers</b> for a less disjointed and referential
approach.
</p><p>Analysis is a complicated matter, and relies heavily upon the skill
and experience of the analyst; in this case, the primary analyst has over
20 years of unconventional warfare and intelligence experience. Tradecraft
can be defined as the means and methods of intelligence and espionage,
the processes used by intelligence officers, operators, and assets (agents)
to go about their business. The intelligence community, as well as 'non-State
actors' such as Al-Qaida, train personnel in tradecraft dogmatically--a
set of rote procedures to accomplish a purpose. This creates inherent weakness
in the personnel--without understanding the fundamentals of the tradecraft,
they can't "improvise, adapt, and overcome" very well. Any rote procedure
creates a vulnerability that can be turned to an opponent's advantage,
and in this case, perhaps that advantage can lead to identification and
neutralization of Al-Qaida sleeper agents. The killing of innocents, by
any side, in any conflict, is reprehensible and should be prevented, but
not at the cost of limiting the freedoms, the pursuit of life and liberty
that is essential to happiness. It's like going into a knife fight with
a dull blade and one hand tied behind your back, but to do otherwise makes
the fight, and a victory, meaningless.

<p>[<i>This is the original Cryptome document introduction.</i>]
</p><p>8 December 2001. Thanks to WM and SA.
</p><p>Several commentators have observed that this manual appears to be a
compilation of material drawn from various military, intelligence and law
enforcement manuals for internal security, guerilla and covert operations
around the globe, and thus is not unique for its alleged sponsorship by
Al Qaeda -- which is not mentioned in the manual. Most of these manuals
make use of each other's offerings and are studied and emulated worldwide
by internal security, military, intelligence and commercial organizations
for offensive and defensive purposes. For more on "terrorism manuals,"
search Google on the term.
</p><p>[<i>True. Just as in the hacker community, where details of a technical
vulnerability can cross the globe in minutes, and 'exploit' code can become
available in hours, the 'tempo' of communication and information sharing
among non-State actors is rapid, and a contributing factor in why they
are formidable opponents. What one group finds useful quickly propagates
to other groups for application, an 'evolution' that is difficult for bureaucratic
organizations, such as conventional military and intelligence organizations,
to respond to.</i>]

of the Afghan Jihad</a>" was allegedly discovered in September 2001 which
was claimed to be so frightening that most of it could not be made public
-- not unlike claims made by the Department of Justice for parts of this
manual.
</p><p>It is not yet clear whether any of these manuals are authentic, or are
fabrications for disinformation and propaganda, as described in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020414171736/http://cryptome.org/dsb-psyop.htm">The

To those champions who avowed the truth day and night...&nbsp;
...And wrote with their blood and sufferings these phrases...

-*- The confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate
regimes does not know Socratic debates..., Platonic ideals...,&nbsp;
nor Aristotelian diplomacy. But it knows the dialogue of
bullets, the ideals of assassination, bombing, and destruction,
and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun.</pre>
[<i>This is interesting rhetoric, but most notable is the 'apostate' reference.
While the U.S. concentrates on the events of 11Sept2001, the use of the
term is directed at Islamic States that don't meet the interpretation of
Al-Qaida's view of Islam, notably Saudi Arabia. This implies that the U.S.-centric
view of the world, and the 'war on terror' in particular, have little to
do with how Al-Qaida itself sees the conflict: control of Islam, control
of the Holy Cities.</i>]
<pre>***...
Islamic governments have never and will never be established
through peaceful solutions and cooperative councils. They are&nbsp;
established as they [always] have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by pen and gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by word and bullet&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by tongue and teeth</pre>
[<i>The two components that contribute to the world-view of an Al-Qaida
member, culture and religious interpretation, are unified in a way that
occurs naturally in a 'warrior culture' (see Japan's 'bunbu itchi' or 'pen
and sword in accord') but is largely alien to the Western form of thought.
Islam is not 'just a religion,' but a way of life; this interpretation
of Islam, therefore, makes the struggle ('jihad'--poorly translated in
this document, which would have the reader believe it was merely about
fighting and force of arms, rather than of ideas and an ontology) as inherent
as breathing. This is no room for compromise, no room for reinterpretation,
no way to surrender short of death itself.</i>]

[<i>If this is a reference to the original document itself, it shows a
rather naive approach to operations security (opsec). On the other hand,
it is probably a novel concept that tradecraft can be attacked, or taken
advantage of, so control of the handbook is likely considered to be less
important than the details of planned operations. Note that the U.S. itself
is split on this issue--concerns for 'sources and methods' in the intelligence
community, while the U.S. military makes their Field Manuals (FMs) available
for similar vulnerability analysis and exploitation.</i>]

<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>[<i>The language here is worth considering for what it tells us about
the mindset and profile of an Al-Qaida operator. First, the language is
intentionally chosen, and selected from various areas of the Qur'an. Clothes
are given by Allah for protection and beautification ("We have sent down
clothes for you so that it covers the private parts of your body and also
should be the means of protection and beautification for your body, and
the best clothing is the clothing of piety. This is one Sign from the Signs
of Allâh; perhaps people may learn lesson from it"); loss of clothing
(piety) comes from betrayal of the agreement with Allah (the Covenant with
Allah is the Qur'an; "it should not be that Satan involve you again in
the mischief the way he had gotten your parents (Adam and Hawwa) out of
Paradise and had stripped them off from their clothes in order to uncover
their private parts to each other") or by force. Shaving is a sign of non-belief,
but also an element of the Hajj ("sacrifice a Hady (animal, i.e. a sheep,
a cow, or a camel, etc.) such as you can afford, and do not shave your
heads until the Hady reaches the place of sacrifice") with implications
regarding what is known of the 11Sept2001 operators (did their shaving
indicate that martyrdom was completion of an act of pilgrimage, with themselves
as the sacrifice?). The references to the covenant, the agreement with
Allah as delivered to the Prophet as the Qur'an, and 'o sister' are calls
to fealty and commitment; in the points, it is obviously to martytdom and
sacrifice of self in the greater struggle (Dar al-Harb, the House of War).</i>]

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the name of Allah, the merciful
and compassionate
</p><p>Thanks be to Allah. We thank him, turn to him, ask his
<br>forgiveness, and seek refuge in him from our wicked souls and bad
<br>deeds. Whomever Allah enlightens will not be misguided, and the
<br>deceiver will never be guided. I declare that there is no god
<br>but Allah alone; he has no partners. I a l s o declare that
<br>Mohammed is his servant and prophet.
</p><p>[Koranic verses]:
</p><p>"O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not
<br>except in a state of Islam"
</p><p>"O mankind! Fear your guardian lord who created you from a single
<br>person. Created, out of it, his mate, and from them twain scattered
<br>[like seeds] countless men and women; fear Allah,through whom ye
<br>demand your mutual [rights], and be heedful of the wombs [that
<br>bore you]: for Allah ever watches over you."
</p><p>"O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and make your utterance straight
<br>forward: That he may make your conduct whole and sound and
<br>forgive you your sins. He that obeys Allah and his messenger, has
<br>already attained the great victory."
</p><p>Afterward,
</p><p>The most truthful saying is the book of Allah and the best
<br>guidance is that of Mohammed, God bless and keep him.
<br>[Therefore,]the worst thing is to introduce something new, for
<br>every novelty is an act of heresy and each heresy is a deception.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>[<i>This is particularly striking in that it is an expansion of the
Prophet's marriage sermon. The introduction is expanded with the 'deceiver'
comment. What are identified as 'Koranic verses' are Qur'an 3:102, 4:1,
and
33:70-71. The afterward is new, but calls upon the Qur'an's definition
of deception as the tool of evil to beguile the believer with the attractions
of the world, another call to personal sacrifice to escape from the illusion.
Why is this striking? The use of the marriage sermon is probably an element
in the initiation into Al-Qaida, part of the enrollment process, and so
shows the personal connection between Al-Qaida and its membership.</i>]

<br>that were equipped with the most modern torture devices and
<br>[manned with] experts in oppression and torture. Those youth had
<br>refused to move in the rulers' orbit, obscure matters to the
<br>youth, and oppose the idea of rebelling against the rulers. But
<br>they [the rulers] did not stop there; they started to fragment
<br>the essence of the Islamic nation by trying to eradicate its
<br>Moslem identity. Thus, they started spreading godless and
<br>atheistic views among the youth. We found some that claimed that
<br>socialism was from Islam, democracy was the [religious] council,
<br>and the prophet-God bless and keep him-propagandized communism.
<br>Colonialism and its followers, the apostate rulers, then started
<br>to openly erect crusader centers, societies, and organizations
<br>like Masonic Lodges, Lions and Rotary clubs, and foreign schools.
<br>They aimed at producing a wasted generation that pursued
<br>everything that is western and produced rulers, ministers,
<br>leaders, physicians, engineers, businessmen, politicians,
<br>journalists, and information specialists. [Koranic verse:] "And
<br>Allah's enemies plotted and planned, and Allah too planned, and
<br>the best of planners is Allah."
</p><p>[<i>Note the revulsion, but also the implication of conspiracy (Masonic
Lodges, etc.); the neo-Luddite denunciation of learned professions is not
supported by Islam, nor by the cultures of the region. 3:54 is the referenced
verse from the Qur'an; the implication being that the plans of Al-Qaida
are the plans of Allah.</i>]

</p><p>They [the rulers] tried, using every means and [kind of]
<br>seduction, to produce a generation of young men that did not know
<br>[anything] except what they [the rulers] want, did not say except
<br>what they [the rulers] think about, did not live except according
<br>to their [the rulers') way, and did not dress except in their
<br>[the rulers'] clothes. However, majestic Allah turned their
<br>deception back on them, as a large group of those young men who
<br>were raised by them [the rulers] woke up from their sleep and
<br>returned to Allah, regretting and repenting.
</p><p>The young men returning to Allah realized that Islam is not just
<br>performing rituals but a complete system: Religion and
<br>government, worship and Jihad [holy war], ethics and dealing with
<br>people, and the Koran and sword. The bitter situation that the
<br>nation has reached is a result of its divergence from Allah's
<br>course and his righteous law for all places and times. That
<br>[bitter situation] came about as a result of its children's love
<br>for the world, their loathing of death, and their abandonment of
<br>Jihad [holy war].
</p><p>Unbelief is still the same. It pushed Abou Jahl- may Allah curse
<br>him-and Kureish's valiant infidels to battle the prophet - God
<br>bless and keep him - and to torture his companions - may Allah's
<br>grace be on them. It is the same unbelief that drove Sadat,
<br>Hosni Mubarak, Gadhafi, Hafez Assad, Saleh, Fahed -Allah's curse
<br>be upon the non-believing leaders - and all the apostate Arab
<br>rulers to torture, kill, imprison, and torment Moslems.
</p><p>These young men realized that an Islamic government would never
<br>be established except by the bomb and rifle. Islam does not
<br>coincide or make a truce with unbelief, but rather confronts it.
<br>The confrontation that Islam calls for with these godless and
<br>apostate regimes, does not know Socratic debates, Platonic ideals
<br>nor Aristotelian diplomacy. But it knows the dialogue of
<br>bullets, the ideals of assassination, bombing, and destruction,
<br>and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun.
</p><p>The young came to prepare themselves for Jihad [holy war],
<br>commanded by the majestic Allah's order in the holy Koran.
<br>[Koranic verse:] "Against them make ready your strength to the
<br>utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror
<br>into (the hearts of) the enemies of Allah and your enemies, and
<br>others besides whom ye may not know, but whom Allah doth know."

</p><p>5- We cannot resist this state of ignorance unless we unite our
<br>ranks, and adhere to our religion. Without that, the establishment
<br>of religion would be a dream or illusion that is
<br>impassible to achieve or even imagine its achievement. Sheik Ibn
<br>Taimia - may Allah have mercy on him - said, "The interests of
<br>all Adam's children would not be realized in the present life,
<br>nor in the next, except through assembly, cooperation, and mutual
<br>assistance. Cooperation is for achieving their interests and
<br>mutual assistance is for overcoming their adversities. That is
<br>why it has been said, 'man is civilized by nature.' Therefore,
<br>if they unite there will be favorable matters that they do, and
<br>corrupting matters to avoid. They will be obedient to the
<br>commandment of those goals and avoidant of those immoralities.
<br>It is necessary that all Adam's children obey."
</p><p>He [Sheik Inb Taimia] then says, "It should be understood that
<br>governing the people's affairs is one of the greatest religious
<br>obligations. In fact, without it, religion and world [affairs]
<br>could not be established. The interests of Adam's children would
<br>not be achieved except in assembly, because of their mutual need.
<br>When they assemble, it is necessary to [have] a leader. Allah's
<br>prophet - God bless and keep him - even said, 'If three [people]
<br>come together let them pick a leader.' He then necessitated the
<br>rule by one of a small, non-essential travel assembly in order to
<br>draw attention to the remaining types of assembly. Since Allah
<br>has obligated us to do good and avoid the unlawful, that would
<br>not be done except through force and lording. Likewise, the rest
<br>of what he [God] obligated [us with] would not be accomplished
<br>except by force and lordship, be it Jihad [holy war], justice,
<br>pilgrimage, assembly, holidays, support of the oppressed, or
<br>the establishment of boundaries. That is why it has been said,
<br>"the sultan is Allah's shadow on earth.<sup>1</sup>"

</p><p>Principles of Military Organization:
</p><p>Military Organization has three main principles without which it
<br>cannot be established.
</p><p>1. Military Organization commander and advisory council
</p><p>2. The soldiers (individual members)
</p><p>3. A clearly defined strategy
</p><p>[<i>A structure--hierarchical--defined by a common purpose. This is
characteristic of 'voluntarist' organizations--members are self-selecting,
but of varying degrees of dedication. A 'core cadre' comprises the command
function, those completely dedicated to the purposes of the organization.
A 'clearly defined strategy' is therefore essential in holding the organization
together, since the majority of the membership will not be part of the
core. One of the critical points necessary in understanding Al-Qaida's
organizational structure and decision process is whether cells are under
positive (directed, commanded: "go do this") or negative (coordinated,
given constraints, told when something is a problem: "don't do that") control.
Positive control requires far more communication (C3: command, control,
communications) than does negative control (which is much more "fire and
forget"--initiate an operation, but leave cells to handle things pretty
much on their own). Organizations requiring positive control are more vulnerable
in certain respects--more communication, the necessity of communication,
etc. Negative control organizations leave operating cells with more autonomy,
and they are thus more difficult to disrupt. Cells operating 'on their
own' as it were would need a guiding strategy to help problem-solve without
resorting to potentially dangerous communication with 'command' (which
may betray the identity of sleepers), so the more clearly and simply the
strategic parameters can be established, the better for individual members.</i>]
</p><p>Military Organization Requirements:
</p><p>The Military Organization dictates a number of requirements to
<br>assist it in confrontation and endurance. These are:
</p><p>1. Forged documents and counterfeit currency
</p><p>2. Apartments and hiding places
</p><p>3. Communication means
</p><p>4. Transportation means
</p><p>5. Information
</p><p>6. Arms and ammunition
</p><p>7. Transport
</p><p>[<i>Note the mix of enablers, sanctuary, tools and tradecraft, intelligence,
and armament. By no means is this a complete, or even an ordered (most
important or greatest priority first), list; see <b>Hunting the Sleepers</b>
for applicable rules of thumb for this sort of work.</i>]
</p><p>Missions Required of the Military Organization:
</p><p>The main mission for which the Military Organization is
<br>responsible is:
</p><p>The overthrow of the godless regimes and their replacement with
<br>an Islamic regime. Other missions consist of the following:
</p><p>[<i>This 'mission statement' for Al-Qaida is clearly directed at 'apostate'
States such as Saudi Arabia (a primary focus as the land of the Prophet
and location of the two most Holy Cities in Islam). Note that the missions
are operationally focused, and again, not in what one would consider an
'order of importance.'</i>]
</p><p>1. Gathering information about the enemy, the land, the
<br>installations, and the neighbors.
</p><p>[<i>Tactical intelligence, of direct application to operations. This
is like casting a large net to catch a certain sort of fish--a wide intelligence
program to look for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. 'Local' intelligence
is important for sleepers in order to blend in.</i>]
</p><p>2. Kidnaping enemy personnel, documents, secrets, and arms.
</p><p>[<i>Kidnapping is directly against the principles of good 'operations
security' (opsec) for a sleeper. Capture of documents, secrets, and armaments
is higher risk than one would assume for sleepers. In all probability,
this is a 'rule' for guerrilla war (where it goes make sense) that sleepers
would be told to ignore. Some terrorist groups do consider kidnapping--for
profit, for intelligence, for the media, etc.,--so inclusion of these sorts
of points are indicators that the manual is a more general primer that
requires specific additional training.</i>]
</p><p>3. Assassinating enemy personnel as well as foreign tourists.
</p><p>[<i>Again, a function of some terrorist groups--Egyptian, South American,
etc. Enemy personnel could be assassinated by sleeper agents, but tourists
are too high profile for safety. Tourists are targets because of the economic
impact that such casualties cause.</i>]
</p><p>4. Freeing the brothers who are captured by the enemy.
</p><p>[<i>An extremely dangerous and high-profile sort of operation. Planning
for this sort of operation is incredibly complex, and needs to account
for the risk/return factor. Are the numbers of prisoners worth the risk?
Has little enough time passed that the information they could provide to
the enemy has not yet been acquired (interrogation and torture establish
a clock on how long such information can be assumed to be uncompromised--torture
in particular is like a downhill bicycle race)? It wasn't surprising that
the uprising in the prisoner-of-war camp, where armaments were smuggled
to the prisoners, occurred--it's a lower risk solution to the same problem,
it makes the job of guarding prisoners more difficult (yes, it encourages
killing prisoners, which only stiffens the resolve of those that remain
free to not be captured), and prisoners may succeed in freeing themselves.</i>]
</p><p>5. Spreading rumors and writing statements that instigate
<br>people against the enemy.
</p><p>[<i>Psychological Operations (PSYOP), which requires operational sophistication
to accomplish. Written statements requires a population that can read.
Other media require receivers (which require power, of one sort or another).
Internal and defensive PSYOP could be handled by 'whisper campaigns' but
in many ways, it's better to let the enemy "do themselves in" as the U.S.
did in Vietnam. In Afghanistan, for example, the Northern Alliance are
going to be their own worst enemy--they're little better than the Taliban
in many ways, they enjoy little popular support that will persist over
time, and their failings contributed to the rise of the Taliban in the
first place. Taliban strategic retreats can be spun in PSYOP terms--they
were done to move military attacks away from civilian centers--while letting
the issue of governance fall to the Alliance, a PSYOP disaster-in-the-making
for the Alliance and its supporters.</i>]
</p><p>6. Blasting and destroying the places of amusement, immorality,
<br>and sin; not a vital target.
</p><p>[<i>Not a vital target, but possible points of leverage. Members of
the 11Sept2001 sleeper cells visited Las Vegas. Among the many interesting
points about Las Vegas are the large numbers of tourists that stay in a
very small number of facilities. Anthrax or some other biological warfare
(BW) agent delivered to the casino/hotel systems (through air circulation
systems, HVAC) would expose tens of thousands at a time; most of those
individuals would enter the mass transportation systems (airports, aircraft,
trains, buses), spreading the infectious agent/infection, and arriving
back at their home destinations before common incubation periods would
become an issue. Yes, the CDC is prepared to deliver 'push-packages' to
cities in the U.S., but could it handle tens of thousands of possible cases
throughout the entire U.S. and the world? Could airports and aircraft be
decontaminated effectively? The 'test cases' of anthrax through the U.S.
postal system expose the frightening potential of BW agents--the spores
persist, travel, and are a trickier problem than thought. Even with few
fatalities, the mass transportation systems of the U.S. would come to a
crashing halt.</i>]
</p><p>7. Blasting and destroying the embassies and attacking vital
<br>economic centers.
</p><p>[<i>The prior attacks of Al-Qaida fell mostly in this category, including
the events of 11Sept2001. Attacking economic centers is an interesting
evolution in terrorism. Terror attacks could be on leadership (assassination),
strategic, or attrition. The strategic implication of economic center attacks
is to create a relative weakness--if the U.S. (or Saudi Arabia--this isn't
U.S.-centric) feels the economic 'pinch' of the attacks, it cascades throughout
the economy (yes, the return of the 'domino' theory, only it does apply
in economics while it didn't in geopolitics). Much of the U.S.'s military
strength comes from the ability to trade dollars for lives--putting military
equipment at risk, rather than soldiers. World War II was largely won by
the U.S.'s ability to keep throwing materiel into the fight, while depriving
the enemy of their own economic power. Political implications are also
critical--failing economies tend to force Americans to look domestically,
and have less interest outside the borders. Mass attrition attack remain
another possibility--use of some Weapon of Mass Destruction (nuclear, chemical,
biological, radiological) to kill large numbers of the population, critical
population segments (financial, early responders, etc.), or deny critical
locations (Wall Street and other exchanges, Silicon Valley, etc.).</i>]
</p><p>8. Blasting and destroying bridges leading into and out of the
<br>cities.
</p><p>[<i>Cities have 3-7 days of 'inertia'--supplies on the shelves necessary
to support the population. Some cities are more vulnerable than others
(e.g. the California Bay Area), and some cities would be in trouble even
more rapidly if additional attacks were staged (water, sanitation, power).
While not mentioned, it should be assumed that tunnels and mass transportation
'nexus' points would be considered targets as well.</i>]
</p><p>[<i>These points are an odd mix of 'sleeper-possible' targets and more
conventional guerrilla/terror targets. Sleepers are hoarded--a player only
uses such pieces on the board when the sacrifice is worth the move. What
a commander is willing to 'spend' sleepers on is indicative of resources
(how many sleepers), and the risk/return decision-making process. If the
tape of the bin Laden gathering that the U.S. Department of Defense released
is accurate, what should be considered 'chilling' is not the scale of death
that was achieved, but that the original operational 'battle damage assessment'
was predicted to be much lower than actual. At the cost of ~20 lives and
$500,000US, the operation would kill the passengers, and a contained number
of floors in WTC (as well as the financial consequences--critical to factor
in, if Al-Qaida profited by their foreknowledge of the attacks in the financial
markets). Either Al-Qaida has more sleepers at their disposal than one
would like to imagine, or the cost per casualty in terms of risk/return
is very different than is commonly assumed. Complicating the assessment
is the certain knowledge of the probable U.S. response to the attacks.
Something more is clearly going on than a 'one-off' attack.</i>]

</p><p>Importance of the Military Organization:
</p><p>1. Removal of those personalities that block the call's path.
<br>[A different handwriting:] All types of military and
<br>civilian intellectuals and thinkers for the state.
</p><p>2. Proper utilization of the individuals' unused capabilities.
</p><p>3. Precision in performing tasks, and using collective views on
<br>completing a job from all aspects, not just one.
</p><p>4. Controlling the work and not fragmenting it or deviating
<br>from it.
</p><p>5. Achieving long-term goals such as the establishment of an
<br>Islamic state and short-term goals such as operations
<br>against enemy individuals and sectors.
</p><p>6. Establishing the conditions for possible confrontation with
<br>the regressive regimes and their persistence.
</p><p>7. Achieving discipline in secrecy and through tasks.
</p><p>[<i>The translation for this section is clearly awkward and leaving
much to be desired. Rather than 'importance,' this is probably best thought
of as 'purpose' or 'function.' As seems to be the pattern, this is not
an ordered list (item 5 would be near the top if it were). Item 1 is a
function of expedience--remove obstacles. Item 2 turns to personal empowerment
for the betterment of the organization--use the talents and skills of the
personnel. Item 3 could almost come from a popular culture management text--do
the job right, get the team to provide their input to accomplish the job.
Item 4 is more management 'wisdom'--stay on purpose, stay on message; what's
interesting is the way this plays off against compartmentalization, where
leadership would break a project up into tasks for security purposes. Cells
of the organization are clearly directed to be as self-sufficient in operations
as possible--a different approach to security. Compartmentalization is
useful when team members are security risks, and full knowledge with a
cell would compromise the overall operation. Centralization of 'the work'
implies a certain degree of trust in the cell members, while not trusting
communication channels or other 'support' cells. The 11Sept2001 cells knew
the rough parameters of the missions, as well as the fact that they were
chosen for 'martyrdom' missions; if the bin Laden tape released by the
U.S. Department of Defense is accurate, cell members didn't know the exact
target of the mission until shortly before the operation took place. This
still implies a great deal of trust in the cell members (the time between
selection/training and the operation was considerable); they had little
supervision, access to considerable resources, and could have 'defected'
at any time, but didn't. Item 5 is the primary focus of Al-Qaida; Saudi
Arabia is the essential target, although Afghanistan was an opportunity
that Al-Qaida seemed to feel it couldn't pass up. Item 6 facilitates item
5--if you can't establish an Islamic (in their interpretation of Islam)
State, then prepare the way through operations, building a support base,
laying the ground work. In retrospect, item 6 may explain much of bin Laden's
focus during the U.S.-supported Afghan war against the Soviets--the real
question is whether his planning horizon was that far out in time. Item
7 is essential in any opposition force--in an ordered list, it would be
near the top. Security is safety, the luxury of continued existence, planning,
and operations. The fact that Al-Qaida appears not to have suffered a human
penetration (HUMINT, or human intelligence), and takes care of their operations
security (against signals and technical intelligence, SIGINT and TECHINT),
means that discipline is very good indeed.</i>]

QUALIFICATIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FOR THE ORGANIZATION’S MEMBERS
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<b>UK/BM-15
TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>Necessary Qualifications for the Organization’s members
</p><p>1 - Islam:
</p><p>The member of the Organization must be Moslem. How can an
<br>unbeliever, someone from a revealed religion [Christian,
<br>Jew], a secular person, a communist, etc. protect Islam and
<br>Moslems and defend their goals and secrets when he does not
<br>believe in that religion [Islam]? The Israeli Army requires
<br>that a fighter be of the Jewish religion. Likewise, the
<br>command leadership in the Afghan and Russian armies requires
<br>any one with an officer’s position to be a member of the
<br>communist party.
</p><p>[<i>The aim of Al-Qaida is, after all, to establish Islamic States (by
their interpretation); this can't well be accomplished by non-moslems (nobody
has your self-interest at heart quite as much as yourself).</i>]
</p><p>2 - Commitment to the Organization’s Ideology:
</p><p>This commitment frees the Organization’smembers from
<br>conceptional problems.
</p><p>[<i>This is a "leave the thinking to us" sort of argument--accept the
interpretation of the leadership, they'll tell you what's right and what's
wrong. In Islam, one of the defining points between Shi'a and Sunni is
whether a 'middleman' (mullah, ayatollah, cleric, etc.) is interposed between
a moslem and Allah. This may be coming from the Wahhabism influence in
Al-Qaida, where many moslems are considered in jahiliyya (pre-Islamic barbarism)
or apostate. Most interesting is the organizational implication--hierarchical
control comes in part from control of interpretation, which is similar
to the old Soviet approach (where the definition of a 'good communist'
and the 'dialectic' were controlled by the Party).</i>]
</p><p>3 - Maturity:
</p><p>The requirements of military work are numerous, and a minor
<br>cannot perform them. The nature of hard and continuous work
<br>in dangerous conditions requires a great deal of
<br>psychological, mental, and intellectual fitness, which are
<br>not usually found in a minor. It is reported that Ibn Omar
<br>- may Allah be pleased with him - said, “During Ahad
<br>[battle] when I was fourteen years of age, I was submitted
<br>[as a volunteer] to the prophet - God bless and keep him.
<br>He refused me and did not throw me in the battle. During
<br>Khandak [trench] Day [battle] when I was fifteen years of
<br>age, I was also submitted to him, and he permitted me [to
<br>fight].
</p><p>[<i>Contrast this approach with that of many drug distribution networks
in the West, where legal minors are chosen for many tasks in the final
'meet the consumer' phase of drug transactions because of the legal benefits
and privileges of legal minority in the criminal justice system. Guerrilla
warfare certainly utilizes what are considered 'children' in the West,
but Al-Qaida needs individuals more capable (and sleepers need the privileges
of legal majority).</i>]
</p><p>4 - Sacrifice:
</p><p>He [the member] has to be willing to do the work and
<br>undergo martyrdom for the purpose of achieving the goal and
<br>establishing the religion of majestic Allah on earth.
</p><p>[<i>The argument between interpretation of Qur'an for and against martyrdom
is too extensive to enter into here. As referenced earlier, however, regarding
shaving and whether the 11Sept2001 operators should be considered as self-'sacrifices.'
The Qur'an is not quite as clear on suicide as many make it out to be.
4:29 of the Qur'an says, in one translation: "O ye who believe! Eat not
up your property among yourselves in vanities: But let there be amongst
you Traffic and trade by mutual good-will: Nor kill (or destroy) yourselves:
for verily Allah hath been to you Most Merciful!" This is not the strongest
of language against suicide; in Western languages, it seems more like "don't
kill yourself, Allah has given you much to live for." Another translation
muddies the water further: "O you who believe! do not devour your property
among yourselves falsely, except that it be trading by your mutual consent;
and do not kill your people; surely Allah is Merciful to you." This translation
makes more sense in the context, and refers not to suicide, but the killing
of fellow moslems (Dar al-Islam, the House of Islam). If this interpretation
is the 'proper' one for Al-Qaida, what of the moslems killed in the 11Sept2001
attacks? Are they jahiliyya or apostate? Or is the 'benefit of the doubt'
given that they were indeed true and faithful moslems? The Qur'an states
in 2:190: "Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not
transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors." Al-Qaida wouldn't
be in a 'state of Islam' if they killed fellow moslems without making amends.
4:92 of the Qur'an says: "Never should a believer kill a believer; but
(If it so happens) by mistake, (Compensation is due): If one (so) kills
a believer, it is ordained that he should free a believing slave, and pay
compensation to the deceased's family, unless they remit it freely. If
the deceased belonged to a people at war with you, and he was a believer,
the freeing of a believing slave (Is enough). If he belonged to a people
with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance, compensation should be paid
to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this
beyond their means, (is prescribed) a fast for two months running: by way
of repentance to Allah: for Allah hath all knowledge and all wisdom." The
events of 11Sept2001 wouldn't qualify as a mistake, but even if interpreted
as such, it will be interesting to see how bin Laden and Al-Qaida make
compensation. Reluctance on the part of bin Laden to kill Afghans, even
allied with the U.S. as part of the 'war on terror,' shows that some interpretation
along these lines is probable (was the 'collapse' of the Taliban and Al-Qaida
related in some way to this? time may tell). This subject is one of the
most fundamental aspects of Al-Qaida members' profiles that needs to be
developed.]</i>
</p><p>5 - Listening and Obedience:
</p><p>In the military, this is known today as discipline. It is
<br>expressed by how the member obeys the orders given to him.
<br>That is what our religion urges. The Glorious says, “O, ye
<br>who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger and those
<br>charged with authority among you.” In the story of Hazifa
<br>Ben Al-Yaman - may Allah have mercy on him - who was
<br>exemplary in his obedience to Allah’s messenger - Allah
<br>bless and keep him. When he [Mohammed] - Allah bless and
<br>keep him - sent him to spy on the Kureish and their allies
<br>during their siege of Madina, Hazifa said, “As he
<br>[Mohammed] called me by name to stand, he said, ‘Go get me
<br>information about those people and do not alarm them about
<br>me.’
</p><p>[<i>The first quote is 4:59 in the Qur'an: "O ye who believe! Obey Allah,
and obey the Messenger, and those charged with authority among you. If
ye differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger,
if ye do believe in Allah and the Last Day: That is best, and most suitable
for final determination." This quote establishes the Qur'an as the final
arbiter--which Al-Qaida has already usurped in item 2 above, "commitment
to the organization's ideology." The story regarding the Medina attack
is interesting because of the Prophet's reinforcement of Hazifa's courage
to go among the enemy, telling Hazifa to "fear none." The moslems with
the Prophet were in a low state, to say the least, yet circumstances led
to victory, and establishment of the Hajj. Such stories have significant
meaning for sleepers as well as guerrilla groups--have faith, be obedient,

</p><p>As I departed, I saw Abou Soufian and I placed an arrow in
<br>the bow. I [then] remembered the words of the messenger -Allah
<br>bless and keep him - 'do not alarm them about me.'
</p><p>If I had shot I would have hit him."
</p><p>[<i>The implication here for sleeper agents is to not warn or alarm
the enemy if at all possible; in guerrilla warfare, this is a critical
element of success--strike where attention and preparation are inadequate
or absent.</i>]
</p><p>6- Keeping Secrets and Concealing Information
</p><p>[This secrecy should be used] even with the closest people,
<br>for deceiving the enemies is not easy. Allah says, "Even
<br>though their plots were such that as to shake the hills!
<br>[Koranic verse]." Allah's messenger - God bless and keep
<br>him - says, "Seek Allah's help in doing your affairs in
<br>secrecy.”
</p><p>[<i>This is a clear effort at operational security (opsec) against penetration
or 'doubling' by members of the organization, or the possibility of 'leaks'
to family and friends. The Qur'an quote regarding the plots of enemies
is 14:46: "Mighty indeed were the plots which they made, but their plots
were (well) within the sight of Allah, even though they were such as to
shake the hills!" The second point is taken from two Qur'an quotes, 4:81
and 4:114: "They have 'Obedience' on their lips; but when they leave thee,
a section of them Meditate all night on things very different from what
thou tellest them. But Allah records their nightly (plots): So keep clear
of them, and put thy trust in Allah, and enough is Allah as a disposer
of affairs." and "In most of their secret talks there is no good: But if
one exhorts to a deed of charity or justice or conciliation between men,
(Secrecy is permissible): To him who does this, seeking the good pleasure
of Allah, We shall soon give a reward of the highest (value)." The 'just'
nature of the organization's purpose justifies the necessity of secrecy
in protecting operations.</i>]
</p><p>It was said in the proverbs, "The hearts of freemen are the
<br>tombs of secrets" and "Moslems' secrecy is faithfulness,
<br>and talking about it is faithlessness." [Mohammed] - God
<br>bless and keep him - used to keep work secrets from the
<br>closest people, even from his wife A'isha- may Allah's
<br>grace be on her.
</p><p>[<i>This is important because sleepers live among non-moslems, and may
develop relationships that would perhaps encourage 'defection' or disclosure
of operations.</i>]
</p><p>7. Free of Illness
</p><p>The Military Organization's member must fulfill this
<br>important requirement. Allah says, "There is no blame for
<br>those who are infirm, or ill, or who have no resources to
<br>spend.”
</p><p>[<i>Fitness is essential to physical operations; those that are ill
may have greater support costs, less availability, and there's an additional
security risk (talking under sedation).</i>]
</p><p>8. Patience
</p><p>[The member] should have plenty of patience for
<br>[enduring] afflictions if he is overcome by the enemies.
<br>He should not abandon this great path and sell himself and his
<br>religion to the enemies for his freedom. He should be
<br>patient in performing the work, even if it lasts a long
<br>time.
</p><p>[<i>An unappreciated characteristic of the best personnel in special
operations, patience is essential in developing adequate intelligence,
waiting for the opportunity when success has the greatest potential, development
of necessary skills, proper planning, etc. Few lasting victories as rapidly
achieved--Rome wasn't built in a day, nor did it fall in one.</i>]
</p><p>9. Tranquility and "Unflappability"
</p><p>[The member] should have a calm personality that allows him
<br>to endure psychological traumas such as thoseinvolving
<br>bloodshed, murder, arrest, imprisonment, and reverse
<br>psychological traumas such as killing one or all of his
<br>Organization's comrades. [He should be able] to carry out
<br>the work.
</p><p>[<i>Sleepers need this ability to a great degree--anger, fear, uncertainty,
doubt, etc. exhibit in body language, which can betray operations. U.S.
Secret Service and other law enforcement train to detect indicators of
hostile behavior. Internal security, particularly enforcement of discipline
or removal of security risks, would require personnel to 'prune' their
own organization, sometimes a very difficult task psychologically (having
fought together, lived together, eaten together--the very things that create
internal cohesion can be barriers to removal of internal threats).</i>]
</p><p>10. Intelligence and Insight
</p><p>When the prophet - Allah bless and keep him - sent Hazifa
<br>Ben Al-Yaman to spy on the polytheist and [Hafiza] sat
<br>among them, Abou Soufian said, "Let each one of you look at
<br>his companion." Hazifa said to his companion, 'Who are
<br>you?" The companion replied, “So-and-so son of so-and-so.”

</p><p>In World War I, the German spy, Julius Seelber [PH]managed
<br>to enter Britain and work as a mail examiner due to the
<br>many languages he had mastered. From the letters, he
<br>succeeded in obtaining important information and sent it to
<br>the Germans. One of the letters that he checked was from a
<br>lady who had written to her brother's friend in the fleet.
<br>She mentioned that her brother used to live with her until
<br>he was transferred to a secret project that involved
<br>commercial ships. When Seelber read that letter, he went
<br>to meet that young woman and blamed her for her loose
<br>tongue in talking about military secrets. He, skillfully,
<br>managed to draw out of her that her brother worked in a
<br>secret project for arming old commercial ships. These
<br>ships were to be used as decoys in the submarine war in
<br>such a way that they could come close to the submarines, as
<br>they appeared innocent. Suddenly, cannonballs would be
<br>fired from the ships's hidden cannons on top of the ships,
<br>which would destroy the submarines. 48 hours later that
<br>secret was handed to the Germans.
</p><p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Caution and Prudence
</p><p>In his battle against the king of Tomedia [PHI, the Roman
<br>general Speer [PH]sent an emissary to discuss with that
<br>king the matter of truce between the two armies. In
<br>reality, he had sent him to learn about the Tomedians'
<br>ability to fight. The general picked, Lilius [PH], one of
<br>his top commanders, for that task and sent with him some of
<br>his officers, disguised as slaves. During that mission,
<br>one of the king's officers, Sifax [PH]pointed to one of
<br>the [disguised] slaves and yelled, "That slave is a Roman
<br>officer I had met in a neighboring city. He was wearing a
<br>Roman uniform." At that point, Lilius used a clever trick
<br>and managed to divert the attention of the Tomedians from
<br>that by turning to the disguised officer and quickly
<br>slapping him on the face a number of times. He reprimanded
<br>him for wearing a Roman officer'suniform when he was a
<br>slave and for claiming a status that he did not deserve.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<b>UK/BM-18
TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>The officer accepted the slaps quietly. He bowed his head
<br>in humility and shame, as slaves do. Thus, Sifax men thought
<br>that officer was really a slave because they could
<br>not imagine that a Roman officer would accept these hits
<br>without defending himself.
</p><p>King Sifax prepared a big feast for Lilius and his
<br>entourage and placed them in a house far away from his camp
<br>so they could not learn about his fortifications. They
<br>[the Romans] made another clever trick on top of the first
<br>one. They freed one of their horses and started chasing him
<br>in and around the camp. After they learned about the extent
<br>of the fortifications they caught the horse and, as planned,
<br>managed to abort their mission about the truce agreement.
<br>Shortly after their return, the Roman general attacked King
<br>Sifax' camp and burned the fortifications. Sifax was forced
<br>to seek reconciliation.
</p><p>B. There was a secret agent who disguised himself as an
<br>American fur merchant. As the agent was playing cards aboard
<br>a boat with some passengers, one of the players asked him
<br>about his profession. He replied that he was a "fur merchant."
<br>The women showed interest [in him] and began asking the agent -
<br>the disguised fur merchant - many questions about the types
<br>and prices of fur. He mentioned fur price figures that amazed
<br>the women. They started avoiding and regarding him with
<br>suspicion, as though he were a thief, or crazy.
</p><p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; Truthfulness and Counsel
</p><p>The Commander of the faithful, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab - may
<br>Allah be pleased with him - asserted that this characteristic
<br>was vital in those who gather information and work as spies
<br>against the Moslems' enemies. He [Omar] sent a letter to Saad
<br>Ibn Abou Wakkas - may Allah be pleased with him - saying,
<br>“If you step foot on your enemies' land, get spies on them.
<br>Choose those whom you count on for their truthfulness and
<br>advice, whether Arabs or inhabitants of that land. Liars'
<br>accounts would not benefit you, even if some of them were
<br>true; the deceiver is a spy against you and not for you.
</p><p>[<i>Omar Ibn Al-Khattab was the second Caliph, notable for his dramatic
spread of Islam. He led a model moslem life (humility when he could have
lived lavishly--an interesting model for bin Laden in many ways). His diplomatic
moves were an example of tolerance, he kept Islam united under strenuous
circumstances, he invented the Islamic calendar, and formed the Islamic
judicial system based on the Qur'an. The Waqqas element mentioned was part
of Omar's successful campaign into Persia while greatly outnumbered (most
accounts converge on a six-to-one ratio).</i>]
</p><p>[<i>The emphasis is upon penetration, short and long term, for strategic
and tactical benefit. Al-Qaida likely has an intelligence network of moles
to compliment their network of sleeper agents, if these three items are
adhered to.</i>]

</p><p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ability to Observe and Analyze
</p><p>The Israeli Mossad received news that some Palestinians were
<br>going to attack an Israeli El Al airplane. That plane was
<br>going to Rome with Golda Meir - Allah's curse upon her
<br>- the Prime Minister at the time, on board. The Palestinians
<br>had managed to use a clever trick that allowed them to wait
<br>for the arrival of the plane without being questioned by
<br>anyone. They had beaten a man who sold potatoes, kidnaped
<br>him, and hidden him. They made two holes in the top of that
<br>peddler's cart and placed two tubes next to the chimney
<br>through which two Russian-made "Strella" [PH]missiles could
<br>be launched. The Mossad officers traveled the airport back
<br>and forth looking for that lead them to the Palestinians.
<br>One officer passed the potato cart twice without noticing
<br>anything. On his third time, he noticed three chimneys, but
<br>only one of them was working with spoke coming out of it.
<br>He quickly steered toward the cart and hit it hard. The
<br>cart overturned, and the Palestinians were captured.<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>____________________
</p><p>1. This story is found in the book A'n Tarik Al-Khida' "By Way of
<br>Deception Methods," by Victor Ostrovsky [PH]. The author claims
<br>that the Mossad wants to kill him for writing that book.
<br>However, I believe that the book was authorized by the Israeli
<br>Mossad.
</p><p>[<i>Note the study of one of the organization's adversaries, the Mossad,
for how they operate as well as lessons to be learned. Such lessons come
from publications (which they question--historically, non-State actors
that are targeted by the Mossad have eventually been assassinated, thus
calling into question the nature of the relationship between Ostrovsky
and the Mossad by his on-going existence) rather than the various Palestinian
movements, which have little in common with, nor little sympathy for, organizations
such as Al-Qaida. Objectivity and observation skills are prized in intelligence
work, as are interpretation and decision-making capabilities; recognition
of these skills is not unusual, given the history of Al-Qaida.</i>]
</p><p>14. Ability to Act, Change Positions and Conceal Oneself
</p><p>a. [An example] is what Noaim Ibn Masoud had done in his
<br>mission to cause agitation among the tribes of Koraish,
<br>those of Ghatfan, and the Jews of Koreitha. He would control
<br>his reactions and managed to skillfully play his role.
<br>Without showing signs of inconsistency, he would show his
<br>interest and zeal towards the Jews one time and show his
<br>concern about the Koraish at another.
</p><p>b. In 1960, a car driven by an American colonel collided
<br>with a truck. The colonel lost consciousness, and while

</p><p>fluently. It was later discovered that the colonel was a

<br>fought in Korea in order to conceal his true identity and
<br>to gather information and critical secrets. If not for the
<br>collision, no one would have suspected or confronted him.

</p><p><u>Financial Security Precautions</u>:
</p><p>1. Dividing operational funds into two parts: One part is to
<br>be invested in projects that offer financial return, and
<br>the other is to be saved and not spent except during
<br>operations.
</p><p>2. Not placing operational funds [all] in one place.
</p><p>3. Not telling the Organization members about the location of
<br>the funds.
</p><p>4. Having proper protection while carrying large amounts of
<br>money.
</p><p>5. Leaving the money with non-members and spending it as
<br>needed.
</p><p>[<i>Note that none of these items mention counterfeit currency. Item
one recommends putting part of the money 'to work'--making more money at
the risk of losing the investment, which is why the admonition to save
the other part for operational purposes. This indicates that the 'risk
profile' of the organization is less risk-averse when it comes to financial
resources. It may also be a way to talent-spot--finding organizational
members with a knack for making money out of money. The next items are
clearly security measures--dispersal of funds, compartmentalization of
knowledge about funds (to compartmentalize the investment/banking function,
or to prevent 'sleepers' from defecting with the funds?), safety of monetary
transportation, and utilization of non-institutional banking mechanisms
(hawala networks; keeping cash with contacts not likely to be arrested;
keeping deposits made in conventional financial institutions out of the
names of members). These mechanisms are probably just the tip of the iceberg
for financial controls and the financial network; resiliency of the financial
support of Al-Qaida is one of its strengths, and will allow it to outlive
the personalities that drive the organization.</i>]
</p><p><u>Forged Documents (Identity Cards, Records Books, Passports)</u>
</p><p><u>The following security precautions should be taken</u>:
</p><p>1. Keeping the passport in a safe place so it would not be
<br>ceized by the security apparatus, and the brother it
<br>belongs to would have to negotiate its return (I'll give
<br>you your passport if you give me information)
</p><p>2. All documents of the undercover brother, such as identity
<br>cards and passport, should be falsified.
</p><p>3. When the undercover brother is traveling with a certain
<br>identity card or passport, he should know all pertinent
<br>[information] such as the name, profession, and place of
<br>residence.
</p><p>4. The brother who has special work status (commander,
<br>communication link,...) should have more than one identity
<br>card and passport. He should learn the contents of each,
<br>the nature of the [indicated] profession, and the dialect
<br>of the residence area listed in thedocument.
</p><p>5. The photograph of the brother in these documents should be
<br>without a beard. It is preferable that the brother's
<br>public photograph [on these documents] be also without a
<br>beard. If he already has one [document] showing a
<br>photograph with a beard, he should replace it.
</p><p>6. When using an identity document in different names, no more
<br>than one such document should be carried at one time.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<b>UK/BM-23
TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>7. The validity of the falsified travel documents should
<br>always be confirmed.
</p><p>8. All falsification matters should be carried out through the
<br>command and not haphazardly (procedure control)
</p><p>9. Married brothers should not add their wives to their
<br>passports.
</p><p>10. When a brother is carrying the forged passport of a certain
<br>country, he should not travel to that country. It is easy
<br>to detect forgery at the airport, and the dialect of the
<br>brother is different from that of the people from that
<br>country.
</p><p>[<i>This is a curious mix of precautions. Item 1 is clearly directed
at casual law enforcement scrutiny--serious crimes or suspicion of 'terrorist'
status is unlikely to lead to the bargain posited parenthetically. Passports
are clearly not intended for both travel and normal identification. Item
2 appears to only have been partially adhered to by the 11Sept2001 cells,
of which at least a small number used their actual identities. The validity
of Saudi Arabian citizenship for the large number of hijackers remains
in question--were they really those individuals, or were they cases of
assumed identity or identity theft? Assumed identities and identity theft
are better than purely fictitious identities, which may raise questions
if investigated, and are unlikely to provide the benefits of 'deeper cover'
(such as credit ratings that work to the individual's advantage). Item
3 is essential precaution--know the details of all identities, completely.
Item 4 gives a brief insight into the organizational structure of Al-Qaida
(discussed in more detail in <b>Hunting the Sleepers</b>)--cells have commanders
(something assumed, as standard for such organizational approaches), but
'communication link' implies explicit specialization, possible application
of network theory, and hints of support structures that lead from command
to operational cells. That such individuals may become compromised and
need alternative identities to escape is accounted for in advance, a sign
of realistic planning. The burden associated with such a position is added
to by the necessity of additional memorization; the consolation is that
escape is potentially easier because of the precaution. Item 5 is for the
benefit of sleepers blending in, not looking like devout moslems and thus
raising suspicions. Item 6 is a 'lesson learned' from the colorful history
of other non-State actors, where personnel have been 'caught out' by casual
police attention finding multiple identity documents (Japanese Red Army,
Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, etc.). Item 7 requires either a certain faith in
the documents, or a certain amount of risk--the best way to confirm validity
is to have legitimate documents (the reason for the 11Sept2001 cell members
obtaining U.S. State driver's licenses) or to have them scrutinized by
someone capable of telling the difference between false and real documents.
Item 8 points again at a support network of dedicated personnel--cells
contact command for falsified papers, which are obtained by command from
compartmentalized support cells, and transported to the cells through command.
Item 9 removes leads post-operation, in the event of apprehension, or that
might lead to leverage on a member. Item 10 is obvious and practical--individuals,
especially security personnel, will recognize inconsistencies of identity
for supposed natives, while most foreigners will not. Assumption of identity
or identity theft as a means of acquiring documents certainly requires
avoidance of anyone that would recognize the 'switch.' This item also implies
forged documents of more remote countries--neighboring countries or those
with a common language would have a greater chance of recognizing the inconsistencies
as well.</i>]
</p><p><u>Security Precautions Related to the Organizations’ Given Names</u>:
</p><p>1. The name given by the Organization [to the brother] should
<br>not be odd in comparison with other names used around him.
<br>2. A brother should not have more than one name in the area
<br>where he lives {the undercover work place)
</p><p>[<i>Item 1 is a basic for blending in--look, sound, and act like those
you're trying to blend in with, including using appropriate names. Item
2 is personal compartmentalization--strict boundaries for use of different
identities.</i>]

Organization MILITARY BASES
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"APARTMENTS PLACES" -HIDING
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<b>UK/BM-25
TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>Definition of Bases:
</p><p>* These are apartments, hiding places, command centers, etc. in
<br>which secret operations are executed against the enemy.
<br>These bases may be in cities, and are [then] called homes or
<br>apartments. They may be in mountainous, harsh terrain far from
<br>the enemy, and are [then] called hiding places or bases.
<br>During the initial stages, the Military Organization usually
<br>uses apartments in cities as places for launching assigned
<br>missions, such as collecting information, observing members of
<br>the ruling regime, etc.
</p><p>Hiding places and bases in mountains and harsh terrain are used
<br>at later stages, from which Jihad [holy war] groups are
<br>dispatched to execute assassination operations of enemy
<br>individuals, bomb their centers, and capture their weapons. In
<br>some Arab countries such as Egypt, where there are no mountains
<br>or harsh terrain, all stages of Jihad work would take place in
<br>cities. The opposite was true in Afghanistan, where initially
<br>Jihad work was in the cities, then the warriors shifted to
<br>mountains and harsh terrain. There, they started battling the
<br>Communists.
</p><p>[<i>Sanctuary, a place providing safety and security, cover and concealment,
is considered to be an essential basic element in guerrilla warfare. This
situation needs to be redefined for 'urbanized terrain'--developed areas
such as camps, towns, and cities. Sleeper or other covert operatives that
are 'in place' for extended periods of time need to blend in, act like
those around them ("when in Rome, do as the Romans do"), and do nothing
that would attract suspicion or attention. One of the strengths of modern
non-State actors engaged in resistance operations is 'spot terrorism'--cells
members that have normal lives, switch into operators for the very brief
period of the operation, and then reintegrate into the society around them.
Sanctuary is more than a place, it's a process--how the operator lives
as much as where he lives. Most of the attention in the following points
is about the location, which is striking given the recent history of non-State
operations, which have relied increasingly on 'spot sanctuary' for 'spot
terrorism'--temporary locations prepared specifically for operational support
by core cadre members or isolated support cells dedicated to this purpose
(where 'contact' with the sleepers is non-existent, handled either through
'command' or through pre-arranged dead-drops). Either for security reasons
or because dedicated personnel aren't available, cells are responsible
for their own sanctuary requirements, and such locations are longer term.</i>]
</p><p><u>Security Precautions Related to Apartments</u>:
</p><p>1. Choosing the apartment carefully as far as the location,
<br>the size for the work necessary (meetings,storage, arms,
<br>fugitives, work preparation).
</p><p>2. It is preferable to rent apartments on the ground floor to
<br>facilitate escape and digging of trenches.
</p><p>3. Preparing secret locations in the apartment for securing
<br>documents, records, arms, and other important items.
</p><p>4. Preparing ways of vacating the apartment in case of a
<br>surprise attack (stands,wooden ladders).
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<b>UK/BM-26
TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>5. Under no circumstances should any one know about the
<br>apartment except those who use it.
</p><p>6. Providing the necessary cover for the people who frequent
<br>the apartment (students,workers, employees, etc.)
</p><p>7. Avoiding seclusion and isolation from the population and
<br>refraining from going to the apartment at suspicious times.
</p><p>8. It is preferable to rent these apartments using false
<br>names, appropriate cover, and non-Moslem appearance.
</p><p>9. A single brother should not rent more than one apartment in
<br>the same area, from the same agent, or using the same
<br>rental office.
</p><p>10. Care should be exercised not to rent apartments that are
<br>known to the security apparatus [such as] those used for
<br>immoral or prior Jihad activities.
</p><p>11. Avoiding police stations and government buildings.
<br>Apartments should not be rented near those places.
</p><p>12. When renting these apartments, one should avoid isolated or
<br>deserted locations so the enemy would not be able to catch
<br>those living there easily.
</p><p>13. It is preferable to rent apartments in newly developed
<br>areas where people do not know one another. Usually, in
<br>older quarters people know one another and strangers are
<br>easily identified, especially since these quarters have
<br>many informers.
</p><p>14. Ensuring that there is has been no surveillance prior to
<br>the members entering the apartment.
</p><p>15. Agreement among those living in the apartment on special
<br>ways of knocking on the door and special signs prior to
<br>entry into the building’s main gate to indicate to those
<br>who wish to enter that the place is safe and not being
<br>monitored. Such signs include hanging out a towel, opening
<br>a curtain, placing a cushion in a special way, etc.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<b>UK/BM-27
TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>16. If there is a telephone in the apartment, calls should be
<br>answered in an agreed-upon manner among those who use the
<br>apartment. That would prevent mistakes that would,
<br>otherwise, lead to revealing the names and nature of the
<br>occupants.
</p><p>17. For apartments, replacing the locks and keys with new ones.
<br>As for the other entities (camps,shops, mosques),
<br>appropriate security precautions should be taken depending
<br>on the entity’s importance and role in the work.
</p><p>18. Apartments used for undercover work should not be visible
<br>from higher apartments in order not to expose the nature of
<br>the work.
</p><p>19. In a newer apartment, avoid talking loud because
<br>prefabricated ceilings and walls [used in the apartments]
<br>do not have the same thickness as those in old ones.
</p><p>20. It is necessary to have at hand documents supporting the
<br>undercover [member]. In the case of a physician, there
<br>should be an actual medical diploma, membership in the
<br>[medical] union, the government permit, and the rest of the
<br>routine procedures known in that country.
</p><p>21. The cover should blend well [with the environment]. For
<br>example, selecting a doctor’s clinic in an area where there
<br>are clinics, or in a location suitable for it.
</p><p>22. The cover of those who frequent the location should match
<br>the cover of that location. For example, a common laborer
<br>should not enter a fancy hotel because that would be
<br>suspicious and draw attention.
</p><p>[<i>Item 1 is practical--sleepers don't want to have to keep renting
new places and moving, since moving entails risk (exposure of operational
materials such as guns, explosives, identity documents, etc.). Advanced
knowledge of the rough parameters of the operational requirements are necessary
though; the mention of 'fugitives' implies that not all sleeper operations
would be martyrdom operations. Item 2 is curious from a U.S. perspective--there
isn't a lot of digging related to apartments, so this is a reminder that
most of this preparation is non-U.S. oriented, another reason why, for
example, the 11Sept2001 cell members kept to themselves, they may have
felt inadequately or inappropriately prepared. Escape and evasion is cat-and-mouse
in three dimensions; going up during an escape may be more valuable an
option than immediate egress on the ground floor. Item 3 best requires
a bit of remodeling--placing secure items inside walls (generally behind
plumbing, which throws off metal detectors), but in cities with higher
crime rates, more obvious security measures would not be considered unusual
or attract notice. Item 4 connects with item 2 (another example of how
the document wasn't 'rationalized' by a careful author or editor), and
demonstrates again that the orientation of the training is decreasingly
effective in 'advanced' countries where law enforcement and military tactics
prepare for such things. Item 5 is operational security through compartmentalization.
Items 6 through 8 connect to a critical trait of sleep agents: pretexting.
Plausability is critical in all activities. The location needs to 'match'
the cover identity (large, well-furnished, well-located apartments wouldn't
fit well with a 'starving student' cover identity). Remote locations make
observation of a location more difficult (observers may well be obvious)
but also make operating more difficult on the cell members (their activities
are also more obvious, there is less 'cover and conceal' to their benefit),
so the recommended trade-off is avoiding seclusion. In large urban settings
there is rarely a 'suspicious time,' but in circumstances where cover identity
is critical, timing is important (it wouldn't do for a day-laborer to be
around the house during working hours without a pretext, a reason, an excuse);
in non-U.S. countries, there are also curfews imposed and which would need
to generally be abided by. Holding the pretext together--appropriate identity
corresponding to appropriate location--is reinforced, but again with an
admonition to use non-moslem identities. Item 8 would best apply in countries
outside the Middle East, particularly where moslem appearance would be
less common, and thus a point of profiling for law enforcement. Item 9
is an issue of operational security, because multiple rentals would raise
suspicions. Item 10 is another curious point--operational security would
be compromised if the 'sanctuary' was known to the local security apparatus,
but how would the Al-Qaida cell members know? Avoiding locations of 'prior
Jihad activities' by their own organization, or known in the public domain,
is certainly a good idea. Avoiding locations of 'immoral' activity is mixed--criminal
activities mean that people largely tend to mind their business, there's
a high transient population, etc. The downside is that such areas are generally
under greater scrutiny by law enforcement, and neighbors may be informers
or perhaps be raided for their own criminal activities (where they will
generally attempt to bargain away everyone they know to save themselves).
It would be interesting to hear the rationale for item 11--is the concern
heightened security in the area, the greater numbers of law enforcement
available, or the possibility that such a location may suffer collateral
damage in an attack by some other cell or non-State group? Item 12 connects
to item 7, reinforcement showing how a trade-off was decided--greater risk
through higher traffic is better than greater risk through easier observation/apprehension.
Sleepers need to blend in, and activity is easier to blend with than isolation.
Item 13 is further protection for sleepers--there are fewer questions when
everyone is a stranger (and prefer to stay that way). Isolation from neighbors
is more common in Westernized countries, while the number of 'informers'
relating to the age of an area is distinctly non-Western. Items 14 &amp;
15 are operational security--is the location still safe? Preventing exposure
of sanctuary by avoiding surveillance or 'tailing' is the 'external' member's
responsibility (anyone outside the location); indicating the security of
the location by an indicator is the 'internal' member's responsibility
(anyone inside the location). Symbolic interaction (coded knocks, etc.)
is the transition period from one concern to another. Note the depth of
implied activity (continual observation for security) and commitment (not
putting other cell members at risk, even at the expense of one's own safety).
Item 16 is adherence to a pretext, maintaining the appearances of cover
identities. Item 17 is normal security, even for ordinary individuals,
who commonly rekey locks or add locks that others may not have keys for
(such as the landlord). Item 18 is operational security; normally interior
rooms with no windows are used for sensitive activities (device assembly,
etc.), or basements when available. Item 19 is simple caution in a modern
world, where construction is accomplished as cheaply as possible. Items
20 &amp; 21 are disturbing in implication--use of medical personnel cover.
Physicians have respect and greater privileges in most societies, and are
rarely the subject of suspicion; additionally, physicians would have access
to substances (pharmaceuticals, radiologicals, etc.), be part of 'early
responder' teams, and provide other sorts of advantage to sleeper operations.
Both items support the necessities of pretexting--have the supporting documentation,
blend in appropriately. Item 22 again reinforces pretexting--the concept
is clearly a fundamental element in the sleeper's tradecraft for Al-Qaida.</i>]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Means of Transportation&nbsp;&nbsp;

<u>Introduction</u>:&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is well known that in undercover operations, communication&nbsp;
is the mainstay of the movement for rapid accomplishment. However,
it is a double-edged sword: It can be to our advantage if we use&nbsp;
it well and it can be a knife dug into our back if we do not&nbsp;
consider and take the necessary security measures.


<u>Communication Means</u>:&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Military Organization in any Islamic group can, with its&nbsp;&nbsp;
modest capabilities, use the following means: 1. The telephone,&nbsp;
2. Meeting in-person, 3. Messenger, 4 . Letters, 5. Some modern&nbsp;
devices, such as the facsimile and wireless [communication].

Communication may be within the county, state, or even the&nbsp;&nbsp;
country, in which case it is called local communication. When&nbsp;&nbsp;
it extends expanded between countries, it is then called&nbsp;&nbsp;
international communication.</pre>
[<i>This section of the tradecraft manual should be read not only for tactical
intelligence, but also strategic. If Al-Qaida is an organization that functions
using positive control, the level of traffic necessary to manage cells
and operations presents a significant vulnerability. If Al-Qaida is an
organization that functions using negative control, traffic is greatly
reduced, cells are nearly autonomous, and communication is less of a risk
because less of it occurs. The difficultly for negative control organizations
is the necessity of pre-arrangement--pre-planning, training, agreed upon
codes/ciphers, lower levels of operational support, etc. In addition, the
communication that occurs is much more critical--it's happening for a reason,
and therefore has different intelligence value. Pure information theory
is problematic for intelligence analysis because of the tendency to assume
that all communication is alike in value, which just does not hold in the
real world. Positive control organizations will have greater variation
in the intelligence value of traffic--some intercepts are worth more than
others. Negative control organizations have a greater baseline intelligence
value for message traffic; since exposure is a concern, the message must
be worth the risk. This attachment of value to message traffic is critical
to the evolving field of intelligence analysis. For example, traffic analysis
can remain incredibly useful even when operators use codes or ciphers.
Attachment of valuations to messages in positive control organizations
makes network mapping far easier (identification of command &amp; control
elements); valuation of messages in negative control organizations is less
helpful, but can be used to establish roles of individuals in networks,
and any traffic analysis is helpful--it can identify sleepers. Al-Qaida
sends clear indications that it is a 'negative control' organization through
many aspects of its tradecraft, but this section is particularly helpful.
The recognition of the fatal nature of security lapses establishes an appreciation
for the need for operational and communication security. The means chosen
for communication are intended to be infrequent, to meet the security needs
of sleepers, but clearly inadequate for 'positive control' organizations.
Communication is oriented largely at coordination, 'triggering' actions
or operations, giving warning, etc., indicative of a 'negative control'
approach. For more on this sort of analysis, and the value it has in targeting
Al-Qaida, see <b>Hunting the Sleepers</b>.</i>]
<p><u>Secret Communication is Limited to the Following Types</u>:
</p><p>Common, standby, alarm
</p><p>1. <u>Common Communication</u>: It is a communication between two
<br>members of the Organization without being monitored by the
<br>security apparatus opposing the Organization. The common
<br>communication should be done under a certain cover and after
<br>inspecting the surveillance situation [by the enemy].
</p><p>2. <u>Standby Communication</u>: This replaces common communication
<br>when one of the two parties is unable to communicate with the
<br>other for some reason.
</p><p>3. <u>Alarm Communication</u>: This is used when the opposing security
<br>apparatus discovers an undercover activity or some undercover
<br>members. Based on this communication, the activity is stopped
<br>for a while, all matters related to the activity are abandoned,
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-30 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>and the Organization's members are hidden from the security
<br>personnel.
</p><p>[<i>This categorization is functional--normal communication, a fall-back
mechanism, and a way to signal that there is trouble. Operations security
is an ever-present concern, but the tradecraft is not clarified as to how
they maintain OPSEC under increasing pressure across the types. Law enforcement
and security apparatus are experienced at forcing 'alarm communication'
in order to map networks of sleepers; how this is managed is not addressed
through other than 'normal' tradecraft. Alarm communication, if it is to
occur, would need to be a symbol that takes no explicit communication channel
(party A connecting to party B) and fits in the context and pretext of
the sleepers. Modern covert networks have taken this into account using
the media cycle--part of pre-arrangement in 'negative control' organizations
could be that exposure of any cell members (including voluntary exposure--a
member that knows they are 'blown') constitutes a signal to 'hunker down.'</i>]
</p><p><u>Method of Communication Among Members of the Organization</u>:
</p><p>1. Communication about undercover activity should be done
<br>using a good cover; it should also be quick, explicit, and
<br>pertinent. That is, just for talking only.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>[<i>This is reinforcement of the need to maintain the pretext of a cover
identity. The duration of a communication is related to probability of
exposure--much tradecraft has been developed for 'brush-passes' and 'dead-drops'
and other mechanisms for minimizing contact duration. Personal communication
is very high-risk, but has the advantage of being 'quick, explicit, and
pertinent.' It is also interactive, allowing clarification and (most important)
certainty. The direct nature of such communication provides direct and
indirect risk--identification of sleepers, the risk that one of the parties
has turned, etc. but also that such communication could be under surveillance
in such a way that doesn't tip off the sleepers.</i>]
</p><p>2. Prior to contacting his members, the commander of the cell<sup>2</sup>
<br>should agree with each of them separately (the cell members
<br>should never meet all in one place and should not know one
<br>another) on a manner and means of communication with each other.
<br>Likewise, the chief of the Organization should [use a similar
<br>technique] with the branch commanders.
</p><p>____________________
</p><p>[2] Cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the Organization.
<br>It should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one
<br>another, so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would
<br>not be affected, and work would proceed normally.
</p><p>[<i>Cell structures are 'standard' for non-State opposition forces,
for the reasons mentioned--the operational security that the network topology
affords. What is not clear is whether organizational cells are structured
in a hierarchical network (positive control) or structured into autonomous,
heterarchical networks (negative control) where cells are coordinated rather
than ordered. Either mechanism enjoys the benefits of compartmentalization
for operational security. The tradecraft here implies that while sleeper
cells may be autonomous, a command hierarchy is maintained--ultimately
perhaps not the best of all possible approaches, but the worst of all possible
approaches. Note that a diversity of communication is not explicitly advocated
to improve network resiliency; this may increase complexity on commanders,
so the trade-off may have been made in decision in favor of simplicity.
This is also an explicit assignment of 'roles' in the network--commanders
for cells and branch commanders--that tells us a bit more about the Al-Qaida
organizational structure. Similarities to drug distribution networks are
not coincidental--lessons learned from such organizations have clearly
been adopted, through study as well as direct interaction. The core cadre
of Al-Qaida resembles the core of drug trafficking networks, with the associated
dedicated support networks and replaceable operational cells (similar to
the 'street level' of drug distribution--dealers get arrested or killed
regularly, causing 'churn' in the network membership, but the structure
itself persists).</i>]
</p><p>3. A higher-ranking commander determines the type and method
<br>of communication with lower-ranking leaders.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>[<i>Father, or in this case the commander, knows best. This is clearly
a positive control aspect--imposition of an element of tradecraft on a
subsidiary, even when the subordinate party/parties may know better (technically,
in terms of how it works with the pretext and cover identity, etc.).</i>]
</p><p><u>First Means: The Telephone</u>:
</p><p>Because of significant technological advances, security measures
<br>for monitoring the telephone and broadcasting equipment have
<br>increased. Monitoring may be done by installing a secondary line
<br>or wireless broadcasting device on a telephone that relays the
<br>calls to a remote location...That is why the Organization takes
<br>security measures among its members who use this means of
<br>communication (the telephone).
</p><p>[<i>There is no good cause to assume, under almost any circumstance,
that telephone communication is secure (look up 'semantic forests' on the
Internet some time, or U.S. patent 5937422). Message content identification
and filtering, traffic analysis, etc. are all highly susceptible to technical
means. The tradecraft presented makes an attempt to bring the telephone
back into the realm of useful tools.</i>]
</p><p>1. Communication should be carried out from public places.
<br>One should select telephones that are less suspicious to
<br>the security apparatus and are more difficult to monitor.
<br>It is preferable to use telephones in booths and on main
<br>streets.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>[<i>Public telephones are no more and no less secure than any other.
The rise of mobile telephones (cellular, GSM, etc.) has changed the economics
of making public phones available, dramatically reducing the numbers of
available phones. Given the high level of criminal activity that is discussed
over public phones, the dedication of increasingly powerful technical means
to a decreasing number of installed phones is not difficult. The advantage
of a 'throw-away' public phone--one use, coordinated only shortly before
the time needed (and not by technical means, such as a pager or other compromised
communication channels)--is probability-dependent, and decreasingly convincing.</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-31 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>2. Conversation should be coded or in general terms so as not
<br>to alert the person monitoring [the telephone].
</p><p>[<i>Cryptography takes a message and performs a transformation that
obscures the symbols used to communicate (ciphertext looks like noise until
decrypted into 'signal'--reader makes right). Coding takes a message and
transforms the symbols to obscure meaning. Ciphered communication stands
out (unless steganography is utilized, an issue that is discussed in depth
in <b>Hunting the Sleepers</b>) amid other 'clear' communication. Coded
communications ("How's the weather?" "I bought a Rottweiler puppy.") can
blend into other communication without much notice if structured correctly.
The drawback is that codes must be pre-arranged, because the symbol-to-meaning
mapping is arbitrarily rearranged, the strength of the coding system. Good
coding systems, tailored to the purpose and to the pretext of a sleeper's
cover identity, can evade detection as effectively as, or more than steganography/cryptography
combinations. Note also the assumption of monitoring--tradecraft oriented
at remaining functional even under intense scrutiny appears to be intended.</i>]
</p><p>3. Periodically examining the telephone wire and the receiver.
</p><p>[<i>A bit naive, but probably useful in establishing a certain sense
of paranoia (or perhaps counterproductive: "nothing appears visible, so
it must be safe"). Monitoring equipment can pick up emissions, be installed
at a relay or switching center, or any number of ways that remain undetected.
Any trust in a telephone is misplaced.</i>]
</p><p>4. Telephone numbers should be memorized and not recorded. If
<br>the brother has to write them, he should do so using a code
<br>so they do not appear as telephone numbers (figures from a
<br>shopping list, etc.)
</p><p>[<i>Memorization, particularly of infrequently used numbers, is a difficult
proposition. The coding mechanism recommended is unusual to say the least--play
with it for a moment and see if you come up with anything satisfactory;
even mapping numbers to grocery items becomes problematic with repeated
numbers ("apples, oranges, apples, apples...").</i>]
</p><p>5. The telephone caller and person called should mention some
<br>words or sentences prior to bringing up the intended
<br>subject. The brother who is calling may misdial one of the
<br>digits and actually call someone else. The person ‘called
<br>may claim that the call is for him, and the calling brother
<br>may start telling him work-related issues and reveal many
<br>things because of a minor error.
</p><p>[<i>A conversational coded boundary--handshaking to authenticate communicating
parties prior to message passing. Signs and countersigns must be contextually
appropriate. Consistent coding mechanisms such as this are susceptible
to analysis with an adequate body of source material.</i>]
</p><p>6. In telephone conversations about undercover work, the voice
<br>should be changed and distorted.
</p><p>[<i>Like many elements of the tradecraft in this manual, this one has
me shaking my head in wonder and disbelief. If the conversation is not
being monitored, this is ridiculous. If the conversation is being monitored
'casually' (not fully aware of the affiliation of the sleepers), then this
sort of thing will only attract more intense scrutiny. If the conversation
is already under intense scrutiny, most efforts to 'change' or 'distort'
a voice fall to technical analysis (whispering can, however, provide some
temporary protection), and other technical means (traceback and traffic
analysis) will increase network vulnerability. Additionally, there are
few good pretexts or cover identities that can justify this behavior, or
possession of good technical equipment. If coding fails, cryptography should
be the next resort, not this sort of thing.</i>]
</p><p>7. When feasible, it is preferable to change telephone lines
<br>to allow direct access to local and international calls.
<br>That and proper cover facilitate communications and provide
<br>security protection not available when the central
<br>telephone station in the presence of many employees is
<br>used.
</p><p>[<i>Clearly a non-U.S.-oriented bit of advice. Use by Al-Qaida leadership
of satellite phone systems was obviously an attempt to utilize the best
in communications technology and avoid 'local' issues such as these. Note
that proper cover, a good pretext, and a well-designed coding system wouldn't
require privacy to remain an effective mechanism for communication.</i>]
</p><p>8. When a telephone [line] is identified [by the security
<br>apparatus], the command and all parties who were using it
<br>should be notified as soon as possible in order to take
<br>appropriate measures.
</p><p>[<i>The implication here is specific intelligence acquired by some form
of penetration of local law enforcement or security. Again, Al-Qaida sleepers
may be tasked to penetrate law enforcement, intelligence, military, and
political hierarchies of hostile State powers. Such penetrations may also
be through technical means, through intelligence sharing with other non-State
actors or State sponsors, or various counter-intelligence approaches.</i>]
</p><p>9. When the command is certain that a particular telephone
<br>[line] is being monitored, it can exploit it by providing
<br>information that misleads the enemy and benefits the work
<br>plan.
</p><p>[<i>A classic disinformation approach, but such attempts to run deception
operations need greater than normal operations security. This approach
may also be used to test security of potentially compromised communication
paths--give up a small benefit to the enemy that is listening in order
to gain certainty regarding compromised communications as well as cell
members and those they've been in contact with.</i>]
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-32 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>10. If the Organization manages to obtain jamming devices, it
<br>should use them immediately.
</p><p>[<i>It is unclear what is intended by 'jamming' devices, since jamming
would provide little advantage while at the same time exposing a capability,
and indicating the hostile nature of organization personnel. As discussed
earlier, cryptography (turning 'signal' into 'noise' and back again) would
provide potential security, steganography would conceal the fact that some
sorts of ciphered traffic was being exchanged (data traffic), but still
make traffic analysis an issue (tradecraft that provides an end-to-end
approach is discussed in <b>Hunting the Sleepers</b>). What is clear through
the language however is that any means or methods that become available
to improve communication security will be adopted.</i>]
</p><p><u>Second Means: Meeting in-person</u>:
</p><p>This is direct communication between the commander and a member
<br>of the Organization. During the meeting the following are
<br>accomplished:
</p><p>1. Information exchange, 2. Giving orders and instructions, 3 .
<br>Financing, 4. Member follow-up
</p><p>[<i>This sort of meeting is clearly not internal to an operational cell,
but instead between the commander of a cell and the 'branch commanders.'
Such individuals should have greater training and experience; they also
face greater risks, being valuable sources of information if apprehended.
Information exchange is bidirectional, while orders and instructions are
hierarchically imposed (top-down). Financing would generally mean delivery
of information or identification necessary to tap into Al-Qaida's financial
network through a cut-out mechanism; while cash provides the greatest flexibility,
it also generates suspicion when relied upon too heavily in the conventional
economy. Member follow-up implies two organizational functions--review
of performance and other issues regarding cell members, and feedback from
cell members to the organization. This latter element is unusual, and again
distinguishes Al-Qaida from 'normal' non-State actors; hierarchical, top-down
networks are generally loath to take operational suggestions or comments
from cells, but Al-Qaida has a history of undertaking cell-suggested operations,
as well as using cells to acquire or generate new approaches for a learning/evolving
organization.</i>]
</p><p><u>Stages of the In-Person Meeting</u>:
</p><p>A. Before the meeting, B. The meeting [itself], C. After the
<br>meeting
</p><p>[<i>This is an elaborate discussion of operational security tradecraft
to protect the safety and security of sleepers participating in a personal
meeting. Given the risks, and the potential information such members could
provide to law enforcement and security agencies, entering into this level
of detail should not be considered unusual. It is, however, quite specific
and explicit to the point of losing flexibility.</i>]
</p><p>A. <u>Before the Meeting</u>:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The following measures should be taken:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Designating the meeting location, 2. Finding a proper
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; cover for the meeting, 3. Specifying the meeting date
and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; time, 4. Defining special signals between those who meet.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Identifying the meeting location: If the meeting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; location is stationary, the following matters should be
observed:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. The location should be far from police
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stations and security centers.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Ease of transportation to the location.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. Selecting the location prior to
the meeting and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning all its details.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. If the meeting location is an apartment,
it should not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be the first one, but one somewhere
in the middle.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v. The availability of many roads leading
to the meeting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; location. That would provide easy escape
in case the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; location ware raided by security personnel.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-33 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vi. The location should not be under
suspicion (by the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; security [apparatus])
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vii. The apartment where the meeting
takes place should be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the ground floor, to facilitate escape.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viii. The ability to detect any surveillance
from that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; location.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ix. When public transportation is used,
one should alight
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at some distance from the meeting location
and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue on foot. In the case of a private
vehicle,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one should park it far away or in a
secure place so as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be able to maneuver it quickly at
any time.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the meeting location is not stationary, the following
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; matters should be observed:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. The meeting location should be at
the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intersection of a large number of main
and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side streets to facilitate entry, exit,
and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; escape.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. The meeting location (such as a coffee
shop) should
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not have members that might be dealing
with the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; security apparatus.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. The meeting should not be held in
a crowded place
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because that would allow the security
personnel to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hide and monitor those who meet.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. It is imperative to agree on an alternative
location
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the meeting in case meeting in the
first is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfeasible. That holds whether the meeting
place is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stationary or not.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who meet in-person should do the following:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Verifying the security situation of
the location
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before the meeting.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-34 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Ensuring that there are no security
personnel behind
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them or at the meeting place.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. Not heading to the location directly.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv.&nbsp; Clothing and appearance should
be appropriate for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the meeting location.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v. Verifying that private documents carried
by the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brother have appropriate cover.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vi. Prior to the meeting, designing a
security plan that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specifies what the security personnel
would be told in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case the location were raided by them,
and what [the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brothers] would resort to in dealing
with the security
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personnel (fleeing,driving back,...)
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <u>Finding a proper cover for the meeting</u>: [The
cover]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. should blend well with the nature
of the location.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. In case they raid the place, the
security personnel
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should believe the cover.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. should not arouse the curiosity
of those present.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. should match the person's appearance
and his financial
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and educational background.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v. should have documents that support
it.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vi. provide reasons for the two parties'
meeting (for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example, one of the two parties should
have proof that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is an architect. The other should
have documents
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as proof that he is a land owner. The
architect has
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; produced a construction plan for the
land)
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. <u>Specifying the Meeting Date and Time</u>:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Specifying the hour of the meeting
as well as the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-35 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Specifying the time of both parties'
arrival ana the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time of the first party's departure.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. Specifying h o w long the meeting
will last.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. Specifying an alternative date and
time.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v. Not allowing a long period of time
between making the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting arrangements and the meeting
itself.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. <u>Designating special signals between those who meet</u>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the two individuals meeting know one another's shape
and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; appearance, it is sufficient to use a single safety sign.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; [In that case,] the sitting and arriving individuals inform
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; each other that there is no enemy surveillance. The sign
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; may be keys, beads, a newspaper, or a scarf. The two
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; parties would agree on moving it in a special way so as
not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; to attract the attention of those present.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>If the two individuals do not know one another, they
should</u>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>do the following</u>:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The initial sign for becoming acquainted
may be that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both of them wear a certain type of
clothing or carry
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a certain item. These signs should be
appropriate for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the place, easily identified, and meet
the purpose.&nbsp; The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initial sign for becoming acquainted
does not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [fully] identify one person by another.
It does that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at a rate of 30%.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Safety Signal: It is given by the
individual sitting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the meeting location to inform the
second
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individual that the place is safe. The
second person
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-36 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would reply through signals to inform
the first
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that he is not being monitored. The
signals are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agreed upon previously and should not
cause
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suspicion.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. A second signal for getting acquainted
is one in which
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the arriving person uses while sitting
down. That
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signal may be a certain clause, a word,
a sentence, or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a gesture agreed upon previously, and
should not cause
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suspicion for those who hear it or see
it.
</p><p>[<i>These pre-meeting tradecraft elements could be handled more abstractly
by emphasizing: know the location as thoroughly as possible, and have good
current intelligence regarding the location; be certain that the location
can't be used as a trap, and that multiple escape routes are available;
meeting locations should not be suspicious or under observation; personnel
should be aware of their security during the approach to the meeting, and
not put others at risk; establish a pretext and cover story for the meeting
that is plausible, and that is backstopped with documentation and other
support; details regarding the meeting should be clear, with a fall-back
plan; details should not be communicated with such advance timing that
intelligence regarding the location may become dated, or that would allow
compromise of the meeting to be achieved; those meeting should follow the
tripod of security, and be aware of the other party's arranged "something
you are, somthing you have, something you know" (description, something
visible as a possession, and signs/counter-signs)--and deviation will be
taken as a signal that the situation isn't safe. Note that none of these
things guarantees the safety of the meeting, which is why dead-drops have
been a preferred method of intelligence tradecraft for decades (at a minimum).</i>]
</p><p>B. <u>The Stage of the Meeting [itself]: The following measures</u>
<br><u>should be taken</u>:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Caution during the meeting.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Not acting unnaturally during the meeting in order
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; not to raise suspicion.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Not talking with either loud or very low voices
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ([should be] moderate).
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Not writing anything that has to do with the meeting.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Agreeing on a security plan in case the enemy raids
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the location.
</p><p>[<i>While standard points, item 4 is particularly interesting--it means
that either organizational control remains local, or that messenger service
(by individuals with very good memories) to provide reports to the core
cadre are the preferred method of organizational management. This also
puts the organizational memory literally in perishable form with the individuals
carrying it in their memory--the organization cannot easily get an economy
of scale in 'lessons learned' from its own functions. In addition, network
segments 'knocked out' for one reason or another either need an alternative
communication channel to reestablish contact with the organization, or
they are cut off until positive control can be reestablished from the core
cadre.</i>]
</p><p>C. <u>After the Meeting</u>: The following measures should be taken:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Not departing together, but each one separately.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Not heading directly to the main road but through
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; secondary ones.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Not leaving anything in the meeting place that might
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; indicate the identity or nature of those who met.
</p><p>[<i>Operational security to minimize the 'back-trail' in the event suspicion
is aroused or hostile parties attempt to backtrail.</i>]
</p><p>Meeting in-person has disadvantages, such as:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Allowing the enemy to capture those who are meeting.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Allowing them [the enemy] to take pictures of those
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; who are meeting, record their conversation, and gather
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence against them.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-37 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Revealing the appearance of the commander to the other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; person. However, that may be avoided by taking the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; previously mentioned measures such as disguising
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; himself well and changing his appearance (glasses,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; wig, etc.)
</p><p>[<i>The organization clearly understands the hazards that meetings entail,
which is why it is curious that telephone and meetings are the first two
elements of communication discussed. Both telephone and in-person meetings
afford an immediacy missing in the next communication channels. The trade-off
is the opportunity to improve security of communication in exchange for
the limitations of asynchronous messaging.</i>]
</p><p><u>Third Means: The Messenger</u>:
</p><p>This is an intermediary between the sender and the receiver.
</p><p>The messenger should possess all characteristics mentioned in
<br>the first chapter regarding the Military Organization’smember.
</p><p>These are the security measures that a messenger should take:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Knowledge of the person to whom he will deliver the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; message.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Agreement on special signals, exact date, and specific
time.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Selecting a public street or place that does not raise
suspicion.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Going through a secondary road that does not have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; check points.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Using public transportation (train,bus,...) and disembarking
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; before the main station. Likewise, embarking should not
be done
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; at the main station either, where there are a lot of security
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; personnel and informants.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Complete knowledge of the location to which he is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; going.
</p><p>[<i>Messengers have explicit roles in these sorts of distributed networks
(see more on network analysis in <b>Hunting the Sleepers</b>), and the
unique nature of these roles (knowledge of various cells' membership, locations,
contact protocols, messages exchanged, etc.) makes these individuals a
much greater risk to the organization. Selection for commitment and discipline
of these individuals, then giving them the best possible training and cover
identities, provides the only possible protection for the organization.
The personal nature of the core cadre of Al-Qaida means they trust messengers
more than other means for critical communication.</i>]
</p><p><u>Fourth Means: Letters</u>:
</p><p>This means (letters)may be used as a method of communication
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-38 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>between members and the Organization provided that the following
<br>security measures are taken:
</p><p>[<i>Any form of communication with 'permanence' poses a greater risk;
verbal communication, without audio recording or note taking, is 'spot'
communication--it occurs, and then it's gone. If some sort of preparation
isn't taken to 'capture' a spot communication, the ephemeral nature of
it provides security for the involved parties. Channels that leave or actually
are a persistent record are inherently less secure--relying on 'access
control' for security (which doesn't work--penetration or boundary violation
is a matter of 'when' and not 'if').</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. It is forbidden to write any secret information in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the letter. If one must do so, the writing should be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; done in general terms.
</p><p>[<i>'General terms' or coded terms? A robustly constructed coded system
need not be interactive, it should account for 'stand-alone' communication
channels.</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The letter should not be mailed from a post office
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; close to the sender's residence, but from a distant
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; one.
</p><p>[<i>The 11Sept2001 cells were known to have driven for hours to accomplish
unknown or mundane tasks; distance between sanctuary locations and operational
activities improves security for the sanctuary and the operation, but does
pose a risk during the travel period (see the extensive tradecraft discussion
by Al-Qaida for transportation below, including the highly suspicious activity
of obeying local traffic regulations).</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The letter should not be sent directly to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; receiver's address but to an inconspicuous location
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; where there are many workers from your country.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, the letter will be forwarded to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; intended receiver. (This is regarding the overseas-
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; bound letter).
</p><p>[<i>This use of a cut-out that blends into the context is not unusual,
but it does interpose another point of failure into the communication channel.
Note the pretext of 'many workers from your country'--foreign labor that
repatriates money from 'overseas' is common, and a foundation for many
Islamic banks (the 'float' is incredibly useful to the financial institution;
BCCI utilized this cultural aspect with good effect). Use of the mobile
foreign labor pools (particularly into countries such as Saudi Arabia)
for cover is an effective piece of tradecraft--such individuals are common,
ubiquitous, essentially faceless, and have access to the nexus points of
the political economies. This means of infiltrating assets is a clever
'ontological judo'--using the opponent's strength against themselves. The
'wealthiest' of Islamic countries are the most dependent on imported labor--the
regimes most considered corrupt by Al-Qaida are also the ones that make
themselves the most vulnerable. This may be an indicator where the 'tens
of thousands' trained in Al-Qaida camps have gone to.</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The sender's name and address on the envelope should
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; be fictitious. In case the letters and their contents
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; are discovered, the security apparatus would not be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; able to determine his [the sender's] name and address.
</p><p>[<i>Is it worth calling this piece of common sense 'tradecraft'? Would
Al-Qaida use individual operators without the good sense to falsify a return
address? Breaking tradecraft is considered to be a 'slick, paved road to
Hell' in the intelligence community, but even seasoned professionals break
the rules, get sloppy, get lazy--this may be a reminder to adhere to tradecraft,
even in the smallest of things.</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The envelope should not be transparent so as to reveal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the letter inside.
</p><p>[<i>More common sense--even concerned ordinary individuals use 'safety
envelopes.'</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. The enclosed pages should not be many, so as not to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; raise suspicion.
</p><p>[<i>This would also cause a postage problem, making it necessary to
enter a post office for proper postage (leaving a trail) or guessing as
to the proper postage and using numerous stamps (raising suspicions about
the letter--a key point in the 'profile' of questionable mail now used
in screening).</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. The receiver's address should be written clearly so
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; that the letter would not be returned.
</p><p>[<i>Returned, if item 4 is adhered to, to a non-existent address--either
raising suspicions or leaving the letter in postal limbo.</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Paying the post office box fees should not be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; forgotten.
</p><p>[<i>Obviously so that one can continue to receive mail. Most mail receiving
services (including the U.S. postal service) will notify patrons regarding
due box fees, so this may indicate infrequent access to box--a strong possibility
if such boxes are located at some distance from the sleeper's sanctuary.</i>]
</p><p>[<i>These items are worth considering in light of the 'anthrax letters'
mailed in the U.S. The letters themselves did not indicate responsibility,
origin of the anthrax, or other 'secret' information. It is highly probable
that the post office was chosen for its remoteness from the sleepers' sanctuary.
The return address on the letter that had one was fictitious, but chosen
to 'blend' into the area it was sent from, but also to lull suspicions
of the recipient (the fictitious return address may not indicate former
residence in the area, but simply good and creative tradecraft). The envelopes
did apparently feel 'gritty,' some indication as to what was inside, and
raise later suspicions, as did the sealing approach (although leakage of
the anthrax and cross-contamination, not apparently intended, has been
a greater problem than the attack; in addition, cross-contaminated mail
may be the cause of future infections, particularly cross-contaminated
mail that ends up disposed of in landfill). The 'block' print was poor
tradecraft; proper tradecraft would have been to stick to lettering that
used the upright rectangle with a dividing bar as the model (like that
used in digital displays)--such print removes most reliable forensic traits,
so it is unlikely that the individual responsible for writing the letters
and addressing the envelopes had formal intelligence training. The U.S.
anthrax letters would not be inconsistent with the tradecraft presented
in this manual.</i>]
</p><p><u>Fifth Means: Facsimile and Wireless</u>:
</p><p>Considering its modest capabilities and the pursuit by the
<br>security apparatus of its members and forces, the Islamic
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-39 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>Military Organization cannot obtain theses devices. In case the
<br>Organization is able to obtain them, firm security measures
<br>should be taken to secure communication between the members in
<br>the country and the command outside. These measures are:
</p><p>[<i>This is curious, and may indicate the age of the manual contents--facsimile
machines and wireless devices have enjoyed a steeply declining price curve
and steeply increasing market penetration. Many of the items do not make
sense given current state-of-the-art intelligence capabilities, another
factor indicating age. Note that where technology is concerned, even 24
months can be considered 'dated'--product turnover cycles every 12-18 months
at the consumer level, compared to 3-5 years at the governmental level,
have provided opposition groups with a significant tactical advantage if
they are willing and able to 'surf the cutting edge.'</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The duration of transmission should not exceed five
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; minutes in order to prevent the enemy from pinpointing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the device location.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The device should be placed in a location with high
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; wireless frequency, such as close to a TV station, embassies,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; and consulates in order to prevent the enemy from identifying
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; its location.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The brother, using the wireless device to contact his
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; command outside the country, should disguise his
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; voice.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The time of communication should be carefully&nbsp;
specified.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The frequency should be changed from time to time.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. The device should be frequently moved from one
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; location to another.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Do not reveal your location to the entity for which
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; you report.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. The conversation should be in general terms so as not
to raise suspicion.
</p><p>[<i>Item 1 is questionable--five minutes is far too long in some situations,
given a level of scrutiny and the capabilities dedicated to locating communicating
parties. Item 2 is simply absurd--the local traffic will do little to camouflage
the message traffic and communication channel if it has already been identified,
and the locations described are those subject to considerable attention
by law enforcement and intelligence agencies, actually increasing the probability
of interception. Item 3 again makes little sense, given current technical
capabilities. Item 4 implies an open channel rather than point-to-point,
indicating pre-arranged tradecraft elements (it's worth noting that 'number
stations' have been in use by the intelligence community for decades).
Item 5 implies very old, conventional equipment--no cryptography, no codes,
not frequency-hopping, no spread spectrum, etc. Items 6 &amp; 7 are issues
of sanctuary--communications are operational elements, and should be undertaken
so as not to put one's self at risk. Item 8 again calls into question whether
'general terms' are adequate, rather than robust coding systems. These
items really do not pertain well to facsimile, nor to modern wireless communication
systems (mobile phones, local short-messaging systems, etc.), which are
put to good use by non-State actors (e.g., mobile phones are used by moslem
forces in the Philippines to coordinate agitation and rioting, as well
as guerrilla attacks).</i>]
</p><p><u>Transportation Means</u>:
</p><p>The members of the Organization may move from one location to
<br>another using one of the following means:
</p><p>a. Public transportation, b. Private transportation
</p><p>[<i>Transportation and communication are two of the riskiest elements
of activity for any operator--movement equates to risk, whether the movement
is of something physical or information. Public transportation is generally
under tighter control of a country's government (air, rail, subways, buses,
cabs, etc.), directly or through licensing (and thus a point of leverage
for investigators), so the trade-off is the potential for scrutiny against
sufficient traffic to blend into. Private transportation affords the freedom
of movement, scheduling, exactness of destination, etc. that provides the
flexibility to make operations easier, at the cost of other forms of exposure
(purchase, licensing, operation, etc.).</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-40 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p><u>Security Measures that Should be Observed in Public</u>
<br><u>Transportation</u>:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. One should select public transportation that is not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; subject to frequent checking along the way, such as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; crowded trains or public buses.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Boarding should be done at a secondary station, as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; main stations undergo more careful surveillance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, embarkment should not be done at main
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; stations.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The cover should match the general appearance (tourist
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; bus, first-class train, second-class train, etc).
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The existence of documents supporting the cover.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Placing important luggage among the passengers'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; luggage without identifying the one who placed it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is discovered, its owner would not be arrested.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; In trains, it [the luggage] should be placed in a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; different car than that of its owner.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. The brother traveling on a "special mission" should
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; not get involved in religious issues (advocating good
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; and denouncing evil) or day-to-day matters (seat
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; reservation,...).
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. The brother traveling on a mission should not arrive
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; in the [destination] country at night because then
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; travelers are few, and there are [search] parties and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; check points along the way.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. When cabs are used, conversation of any kind should
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; not be started with the driver because many cab
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; drivers work for the security apparatus.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. The brother should exercise extreme caution and apply
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; all security measures to the members.
</p><p>[<i>These items are a realistic assessment of the strengths and weaknesses
of public transportation: blend in with the crowd, rely on the necessity
of 'high throughput' of traffic to relax security procedures, use of secondary
entry/exit points and because of lower scrutiny, maintenance and backstopping
of pretext and cover identity, ability to repudiate luggage, reliance on
peak
traffic periods to relax security procedures, care with public transportation
personnel who can later be questioned about operators, and a reminder to
stick to tradecraft.</i>]

</p><p><u>Security Measures that Should be Observed in Private</u>
<br><u>Transportation</u>:
</p><p>Private transportation includes: cars, motorcycles
</p><p>A. Cars and motorcycles used in overt activity:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. One should possess the proper permit and not violate
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; traffic rules in order to avoid trouble with the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; police.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The location of the vehicle should be secure so that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the security apparatus would not confiscate it.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The vehicle make and model should be appropriate for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the brother’s cover.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The vehicle should not be used in special military
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; operations unless the Organization has no other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; choice.
</p><p>B. Cars and motorcycles used in covert activity:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Attention should be given to permits and [obeying] the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; traffic rules in order to avoid trouble and reveal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; their actual mission.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The vehicle should not be left in suspicious places
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; (deserts,mountains, etc.). If it must be, then the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; work should be performed at suitable times when no one
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; would keep close watch or follow it.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The vehicle should be purchased using forged documents
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; so that getting to its owners would be prevented once
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; it is discovered.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. For the sake of continuity, have only one brother in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; charge of selling.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. While parking somewhere, one should be in a position
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; to move quickly and flee in case of danger.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. The car or motorcycle color should be changed before
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the operation and returned to the original after the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; operation.

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. The license plate number and county name should be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; falsified. Further, the digits should be numerous in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; order to prevent anyone from spotting and memorizing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; it.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. The operation vehicle should not be taken to large
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; gasoline stations so that it would not be detected by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the security apparatus.
</p><p>[<i>An odd mix of items. Cars have the ability to carry multiple individuals
as well as cargo; motorcycles have the advantage of mobility, but reduced
carrying capacity (as well as 'cover and concealment'). Obeying traffic
rules to avoid detection is almost counterproductive--there are situations
where obeying the speed limit, for example, is highly suspicious. Proper
parking, selection of vehicle to match pretext and cover identity, and
compartmentalization of vehicles are standard. Items B3 &amp; B4 are curious--unnecessary
risk akin to the mistake made by the first WTC bombers, going back for
their truck deposit. Use of one-off rental vehicles, abandonment of operational
vehicles, or disposal into the black economy would be far more secure.
Preparation for flight as a contingency is always a wise idea (even when
the hunter, think and act as the hunted). Item B6 is a high level of effort
for little return, and could increase risk (acquiring the equipment, purchase
of paint can be traced, location for the activity will have persistent
forensic evidence, etc.). Item B7 is odd in the context of item B3 (and
the probability in B4 that vehicles used will be disposed of post-operation),
and potentially increases risk in some countries (where it may be routine
for law enforcement to 'run plates,' and a mismatch or falsification is
a point of vulnerability). Item B8 is also curious--surveillance does not
map well to size of a station, and larger stations in higher traffic areas
may in fact be safer in some countries. Note that no mention is made of
vehicle sanitization--not leaving operational materials in vehicles, destruction
of potential forensic evidence, etc. The 11Sept2001 cells may not have
been sloppy so much as not being instructed in such a fashion as to make
forensics difficult or impossible.</i>]

TRAINING

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-44 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>* The following security precautions should be taken during
<br>the training:
</p><p><u>The Place</u>:
</p><p>The place should have the following specifications:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Distance from the populated areas with the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; availability of living necessities.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Availability of medical services during the training.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The place should be suitable for the type of training
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; (physical fitness, shooting, tactics).
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. No one except the trainers and trainees should know
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; about the place.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The place should have many roads and entrances.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. The place should be visited at suitable times.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Hiding any training traces immediately after the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; training.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Guarding the place during the training.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Appropriateness of the existing facilities for the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; number of training members.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. Exclusion of anyone who is not connected with the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; training.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 11. Taking all security measures regarding the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; establishment.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 12. Distance of the place from police stations, public
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; establishments, and the eyes of informants.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 13. The place should not be situated in such a way that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the training and trainees can be seen from another
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; location.
</p><p>[<i>Many of the items are difficult to accomplish in developed countries--the
more operationally-specific the training requirements, the harder it is
to isolate the camp from potential exposure. This is a primary reason why
Afghanistan and other undeveloped countries have been selected for training--either
no notice will particularly be taken, or enforcement groups can be co-opted
or bribed. Training facilities are essentially sand-table structures--very
easy to construct, very easy to maintain, simple to lay out for operational
walk-throughs, and not particularly significant when destroyed. Operational
security is observed: isolation, compartmentalization, avenues of escape,
sanitization, and even local medical support to avoid drawing attention
of governmental bodies (is Al-Qaida's medical support limited to medic
level, or are there members with full medical (and possibly trauma) education
and training? It wouldn't be unusual for medical personnel to be involved
(the PFLP was founded by physicians), but the implications of Al-Qaida
sleepers under physician cover identities are significant).</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-45 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p><u>The Trainees</u>:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Before proceeding to the training place, all security
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; measures connected with an undercover individual
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; should be taken. Meanwhile, during training at the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; place, personnel safety should be ensured.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Selecting the trainees carefully.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The trainees should not know one another.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The small size of groups that should be together during
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the training (7-10 individuals).
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The trainees should not know the training place.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Establishing a training plan f o r each trainee.
</p><p>[<i>Item 1 is to ensure safety and security of the training base--operational
security for individuals is essential in the opsec of the base. Item 2
is organizational security--penetration or informers with access to details
of training can put operations at risk. Item 3 is curious--are cells trained
as a group, or as individuals that are later assembled into cells? Group
training improves unit cohesion and decreases security risks (cell members
would only know others in their cell). Training size (item 4) is smaller
than a typical squad--security is traded off against an economy of scale.
From what is known of Al-Qaida training centers in undeveloped countries,
this is not adhered to in such countries, so training is either on-going
after deployment of sleepers, or supplemented for operation-specific purposes
at a later point in time. Item 5 is fairly typical; even in the U.S., when
resistance groups train domestically, precautions are taken to limit knowledge
of training locations. Item 6 may mean that training goals are established
for each individual or that training may be individualized and specialized;
redundancy and cross-training, common for U.S. special operators, may or
may not be undertaken. It appears that the 11Sept2001 cell members did
not completely cross-train (e.g. piloting skills), which would have required
advanced knowledge of operations, and been more costly.</i>]
</p><p><u>The Trainers</u>:
</p><p>All measures taken with regard to the commanders apply also
<br>to the trainers. Also, the following should be applied:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Fewness of the trainers in the training place. Only
those
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; conducting the training should be there, in order not
to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; subject the training team to the risk of security exposure.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Not revealing the identity of the trainer to trainees.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Keeping a small ratio of trainees to trainer.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The training team members should not know one another.
</p><p>[<i>Trainers are a vulnerability to the organization--knowledge of numerous
members, contact procedures, repositories of tradecraft and capabilities,
etc. Items 1 &amp; 2 are for the security of the trainers. Item 3 is an
issue of effectiveness--while a higher ratio would be more efficient, it
would be less effective because of lower level of individual attention.
Item 4 is impractical for most organizations--trainers would be in limited
supply and have greater exposure to one another, and action taken to minimize
this risk increases other risk (travel of trainers, using rotation to minimize
the exposure internal to the organization, which increases exposure externally).
Risk is rarely mitigated, merely shifted.</i>]

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BUYING AND TRANSPORTING THEM
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-47 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>Prior to dealing with weapons, whether buying, transporting, or
<br>storing them, it is essential to establish a careful, systematic
<br>and firm security plan that plan deals with all stages. It is
<br>necessary to divide that task into stages: First Stage: Prior to
<br>Purchase; Second Stage: Purchasing; Third Stage: Transport;
<br>Fourth Stage: Storage.
</p><p>[<i>This section needs to be put into historical context. Non-State
actors in the past have relied on weapons smuggling (including in the diplomatic
pouch of friendly or sponsoring States), a 'black economy' between groups
(trading services or equipment among non-State actors), theft, etc. Some
cultures openly sell weapons--markets in undeveloped countries are well-stocked,
particularly with Soviet-era gear and various knock-offs; gun shows in
the U.S. are similarly easy to purchase weapons at, although this may leave
a (questionable) forensic trail. The manual here assumes purchase of weapons
(guns and explosives, by the discussion) in the local underground economy.
Such weapons are generally stolen, may already have a 'history' (forensic
evidence connecting to previous criminal activity), but are commonly of
indigenous manufacture. While avoiding one set of risks (leaving a trail),
this approach has other risks--faulty equipment, potential informers or
undercover agents, etc. The fact that Al-Qaida doesn't resort to lower
risk, more reliable ways to acquire weapons is interesting--they may not
have access to State support for such activity, may not wish to establish
links with other non-State actors, etc. It's worth noting that the definition
of a weapon is wonderfully fluid--the 11Sept2001 cells used fairly innocuous
box-cutters, the threat of explosives, and turned aircraft into guided
missiles. Almost anything can be turned into a weapon; the implications
of the weapon can be more powerful than the actual effect (being attacked
with a box-cutter, absent surprise, is survivable, as long as one is willing
to be cut).</i>]
</p><p>1. <u>Prior to Purchase Stage</u>: It is necessary to take the
<br>following measures:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. In-depth knowledge of the place where weapons will be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; purchased, together with its entrances and exits.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Verifying there are no informants or security
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; personnel at the place where purchasing will take
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; place.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. The place should be far from police stations and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; government establishments.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Not proceeding to the purchasing place directly by the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; main road, but on secondary streets.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Performing the exercises to detect the surveillance.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; f. One’s appearance and clothing should be appropriate
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; for the place where purchasing will take place.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; g. The purchasing place should not be situated in such
a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; way that the seller and buyer can be seen from another
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; location. To the contrary, the purchasing place
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; should be such that the seller and buyer can see the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; surrounding area.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; h. Determining a suitable cover for being in that place.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; i. The place should not be crowded because that would
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; facilitate the police hiding among people, monitoring
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the arms receiving, and consequently arresting the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; brother purchasing.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-48 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; j. In case one of the parties is unable to arrive, it is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; essential to prearrange an alternativeplace and time
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; with the seller.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; k. Selecting a time suitable for the purchase so that it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; does not raise suspicion.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; l. Prior to purchasing, the seller should be tested to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that he is not an agent of the security
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; apparatus.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; m. Preparing a place for storage prior to purchasing.
</p><p>[<i>Operations security is the general rule: know the location, multiple
routes of escape, avoiding surveillance, blending in and sticking with
a pretext and cover identity, cover and concealment, fall-back procedures,
attempting to verify the dealer, advanced preparation for storing/hiding
the weapons. The testing process in item l is interesting in that there
is no suggestion as to how this is to be accomplished.</i>]
</p><p>2. <u>The Purchase Stage</u>:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Verifying that the weapons are in working condition.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Not paying the seller the price for the weapons before
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; viewing, inspecting, and testing them.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Not telling the seller about the mission for which the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; weapons are being purchased.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Extreme caution should be used during the purchasing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; operation in the event of any unnatural behavior by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the seller or those around you.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Not lengthening the time spent with the seller. It is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; important to depart immediately after purchasing the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; weapons.
</p><p>[<i>Primary concerns here are not getting screwed on the deal and operations
security: checking the weapons (testing is interesting in developed countries,
limiting the possible areas in which such transactions could take place),
verification prior to payment, not giving away sensitive or secret information,
observing erratic behavior (unstated is the appropriate response--if you
have a bad feeling, trust your instincts and leave immediately), and not
prolonging the transaction any longer than necessary (operations are no
time to be social).</i>]
</p><p>3. <u>The Transport Stage</u>:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Avoid main roads where check points are common.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Choose a suitable time for transporting the weapons.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Observers should proceed on the road ahead of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; transportation vehicle for early warning in case of an
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; emergency.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Not proceeding directly to the storage place until
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; after verifying there is no surveillance.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-49 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. During the transport stage, weapons should be hidden
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; in a way that they are inconspicuous and difficult to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; find.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; f. The route for transporting the weapons should be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; determined very carefully.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Verifying the legality of the vehicle, performing its
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; maintenance, checking its gasoline and water levels, etc.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; h. Driving the car normally in order to prevent
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; accidents.
</p><p>[<i>Transportation is lower risk than the transaction itself--as long
as the transaction was clean (and not a set-up). This is a good process
outlined--including an advance vehicle to notify the transporation vehicle,
and presumably a chase vehicle to sweep and identify tails or assist in
the event of difficulty. Operations security is observed: avoiding scrutiny,
identification of optimal route and time for transportation, concerns for
surveillance before going to an arms cache or sanctuary, hiding the weapons,
making certain the vehicle is safe and secure, obeying traffic regulations.</i>]
</p><p>4. <u>The Storage Stage</u>:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. In order to avoid repeated transporting, suitable
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; storage places should be selected. In case the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; materials are bombs or detonators, they should be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; protected from extreme heat and humidity.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Explosive materials and detonators should be separated
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; and stored apart from each other.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Caution should be exercised when putting detonators
in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the arsenal.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Lubricating the weapons and placing them in wooden or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; plastic crates. The ammunition should be treated
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; likewise.
</p><p>[<i>Proper weapons storage is probably the responsibility of an 'armorer'
for the group. Items a through c are safety issues. Item d is to ensure
weapon functionality, although crating presents certain challenges--crates
are obvious, can be difficult to access in emergency, etc. Note that booby-traps
of the cache are not discussed, nor the merits of armed weapons (explosive
and detonator, locked-and-loaded pistols, etc.).</i>]
</p><p>When selecting an arsenal, consider the following:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The arsenal should not be in well-protected areas, or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; close to parks or public places.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The arsenal should not be in a "no-man's-land."
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The arsenal should not be in an apartment previously
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; used for suspicious activities and often frequented by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; security personnel.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The arsenal should not be a room that is constantly
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; used and cannot be given up by family members who do
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; not know the nature of the father or husband's work.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-50 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The apartment selected as an arsenal should be owned
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; by the Organization or rented on a long-term basis.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. The brother responsible for storage should not visit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the arsenal frequently, nor toy with the weapons.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. The arsenal keeper should record in a book all
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; weapons, explosive materials, and ammunition. That
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; book should be coded and well secured.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Only the arsenal keeper and the commander should know
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the location of the arsenal.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. It is necessary to prepare alternative arsenals and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; not leave any leads in the original arsenals to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative ones.
</p><p>[<i>Items 1 &amp; 2 may refer to hidden or buried weapons caches. Item
3 is reinforcement of earlier discussions regarding sanctuary locations.
Item 4 is interesting in its assumptions--adequate room will be available
to the sleeper to dedicate a specific 'forbidden' space to the arsenal
(how this doesn't arrouse suspicions or interest is anyone's guess), as
well as the fact that caches may be placed with sleepers with family (caches
may be kept by support cells rather than operational cells). Item 5 is
operations security--long-term rentals are less likely to be visited by
landlords, and owned property has no such problem. Item 6 is a safety issue--accidents
happen, particularly when given the opportunity. Item 7, an inventory,
is a curious point of vulnerability, which is why the recommendation of
coding. Item 8 is again an indicator that caches are kept with dedicated
support cells, with contact only to the command hierarchy. Item 9 is contingency
planning, preparation to move a cache if/when necessary, and not leave
indications regarding the new location.</i>]

MEMBER SAFETY
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-52 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p><u>Defining Members Safety</u>:
</p><p>This is a set of measures taken by members who perform
<br>undercover missions in order to prevent the enemies from
<br>getting to them.
</p><p>It is necessary for any party that adopts Jihad work and
<br>has many members to subdivide its members into three
<br>groups, each of which has its own security measures. The
<br>three groups are:
</p><p>1. The overt member, 2. The covert member. 3. The
<br>commander
</p><p>[<i>This is contradictory: 'members who perform undercover missions'
and 'overt member.' As with many sections of this manual, indications are
that it derives from multiple sources and is an 'organic' document--additive,
composite, non-ordered, assembled from a variety of sources (U.S., Soviet,
Middle Eastern, Pakistani, etc.).</i>]
</p><p><u>Measures that Should be Taken by the Overt Member</u>:
</p><p>1. He should not be curious and inquisitive about matters
<br>that do not concern him.
</p><p>2. He should not be chatty and talkative about everything
<br>he knows or hears.
</p><p>3. He should not carry on him the names and addresses of
<br>those members he knows. If he has to, he should keep
<br>them safe.
</p><p>4. During times of security concerns and arrest campaigns
<br>and especially if his appearance is Islamic, he should
<br>reduce his visits to the areas of trouble and remain
<br>at home instead.
</p><p>5. When conversing on the telephone, he should not talk
<br>about any information that might be of use to the
<br>enemy.
</p><p>6. When sending letters, he should not mention any
<br>information that might be of use to the enemy. When
<br>receiving letters, he should burn them immediately
<br>after reading them and pour water on them to prevent
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-53 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>the enemy from reading them. Further, he should destroy
<br>any traces of fire so the enemy would not find out that
<br>something was burned.
</p><p>[<i>Overt members, those known to be Al-Qaida, are indicated as being
vulnerabilities: such members should deliberately limit their own knowledge
(voluntary compartmentalization--"don't ask, don't care" about things not
directly related to them), learn to keep their mouths shut, limit or forego
any record of knowledge of other members, be willing to restrict his movements
to reduce vulnerability to the organization, and exercising good tradecraft
in communications (although if they follow item 1, they shouldn't know
anything valuable). That there are overt members is a curiosity in and
of itself, and this should be seen as a limited population in small number
of places (non-hostile countries or those coopted).</i>]
</p><p><u>Measures that Should be Taken by the Undercover Member</u>:
</p><p>In addition to the above measures, the member should...
</p><p>1. Not reveal his true name to the Organization's members
<br>who are working with him, nor to the [Islamic] Da'wa
<br>[Call].
</p><p>[<i>The reference to 'da'wa' is interesting. Da'wa is a process of spreading
Islam, an outreach effort that is an "invitation to follow Allah." In some
ways, this could be compared to missionary work, or proselytization. Many
Islamic relief efforts and educational institutions follow this approach,
including as a way to control interpretation of Islamic faith. As an analytical
point, this may tell us much about the leadership of Al-Qaida--they've
reverted back to the beginning of Islam, and the initial struggles for
political/spiritual control (other indications: the significance of dreams
to leadership members, key role models for personal and organizational
behavior). 'Gnosis,' in this case a resurgence of 'directly delivered'
Islam rather than 'dogma' may be one of the contributing factors to the
charisma of the leadership, and the support base they've managed to build
in grassroots Islam. What is also interesting is the journal of the Egyptian
Moslem Brotherhood in the 70s and 80s was called al-Da'wa, and the Sudan
has the Organization of Al-Da’wa Al-Islamiya; both of these countries are
areas of operation for Al-Qaida, and members of Al-Qaida and these groups
overlap. Maintaining cover identities, regardless of other familiarity
(to get back to the item), is an operational security element of tradecraft.</i>]
</p><p>2. Have a general appearance that does not indicate
<br>Islamic orientation (beard,toothpick, book, [long] shirt,
<br>small Koran).
</p><p>3. Be careful not to mention the brothers' common
<br>expressions or show their behaviors (special praying
<br>appearance, "may Allah reward you", "peace be on you"
<br>while arriving and departing, etc.)
</p><p>4. Avoid visiting famous Islamic places (mosques,
<br>libraries, Islamic fairs, etc.)
</p><p>5. Carry falsified personal documents and know all the
<br>information they contain.
</p><p>6. Have protection preceding his visit to any place
<br>while moving about (apartment,province, means of
<br>transportation, etc.).
</p><p>7. Have complete and accurate knowledge of the security
<br>status related to those around him in his place of
<br>work and residence, so that no danger or harm would
<br>catch him unaware.
</p><p>8. Maintain his family and neighborhood relationships and
<br>should not show any changes towards them so that they
<br>would not attempt to bring him back [from the Organization]
<br>for security reasons.
</p><p>9. Not resort to utilizing letters and messengers except
<br>in an emergency.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-54 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>10. Not speak loudly.
</p><p>11. Not get involved in advocating good and denouncing
<br>evil in order not to attract attention to himself.
</p><p>12. Break the daily routine, especially when performing an
<br>undercover mission. For example, changing the
<br>departure and return routes, arrival and departure
<br>times, and the store where he buys his goods.
</p><p>13. Not causing any trouble in the neighborhood where he
<br>lives or at the place of work.
</p><p>14. Converse on the telephone using special code so that
<br>he does not attract attention.
</p><p>15. Not contacting the overt members except when
<br>necessary. Such contacts should be brief.
</p><p>16. Not fall into the enemy's excitement trap, either
<br>through praising or criticizing his Organization.
</p><p>17. Performing the exercises to detect surveillance
<br>whenever a task is to be performed.
</p><p>18. Not park in no-parking zones and not take photographs
<br>where it is forbidden.
</p><p>19. Closing all that should be closed before departing the
<br>place, whether at home or his place of undercover
<br>work.
</p><p>20. Not undergo a sudden change in his daily routine or
<br>any relationships that precede his Jihad involvement.
<br>Far example, there should not be an obvious change in
<br>his habits of conversing, movement, presence, or
<br>disappearance. Likewise, he should not be hasty to
<br>sever his previous relationships.
</p><p>21. Not meet in places where there are informers, such as
<br>coffee shops, and not live in areas close to the
<br>residences of important personalities, government
<br>establishments, and police stations.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>22. Not write down on any media, specially on paper, that
<br>could show the traces and words of the pen by rubbing
<br>the paper with lead powder.
</p><p>[<i>Covert members of Al-Qaida, sleepers, follow tradecraft to protect
their affiliation and identities: maintaining cover identities and pretext,
not appearing to be moslem in appearance or behavior, backstopping identities,
observing safety and security tradecraft diligently, knowing the risk of
relationships and communication, maintaining a 'low profile,' not falling
into habits or patterns that create vulnerabilities, compartmentalizing
cover identity and operations, usings codes for communication, minimizing
organizational interaction, keeping a level head and avoiding excitement,
taking care regarding surveillance, obeying laws and regulations to avoid
attention, maintaining secrecy, not providing 'indicators' of pending operations
by behavioral changes. While much of this tradecraft is oriented at what
not to do, there is little assistance for what to do in order to blend
in--either such material is in other Al-Qaida training materials, imparted
in special training, is selected for in potential sleepers (those with
experience in target countries), or non-existent (which would encourage
cell isolation from the local context, behavior consistent with the 11Sept2001
cells, which also serves to maintain cell unity and discourage defection).
Absent 'positive' training materials, this is another indicator that Al-Qaida
is a 'negative control' type of organization.</i>]
</p><p><u>Measures that Should be Taken by the Commander</u>:
</p><p>* The commander, whether in overt or covert work, has special
<br>importance for the following reasons:
</p><p>1. The large amount of information that he possesses.
</p><p>2. The difficulty of the command in replacing the
<br>commander.
</p><p>3. Therefore, all previously mentioned security
<br>precautions regarding members should be heightened for
<br>the commander. Many resources should be reserved for
<br>protecting the commanders.

2 indicate that a principle of cybernetics, redundancy of potential command,
is not used--it would require information sharing inside the operational
cell (the more complete the information sharing, the more redundant the
potential commanders, and the more rapid such command could be assumed).
Given the tradecraft of the organization, this is more than a compartmentalization
issue (security), but also structural--command is hierarchical, with authority
coming from greater information and access to information (hierarchy is
defined by positional authority as well as monopoly control of resources--interpretation
(in this case, of Islam) and possession of information). Such information
sharing would undermine authority, although it is doubtful that it is portrayed
as such inside the organization. Lack of redundancy of information and
command is a key structural vulnerability of Al-Qaida. Note that reservation
of resources may also be a source of internal dissention--privileges of
command may well be resented by cell members.</i>]
</p><p>Important Note:
</p><p>* Married brothers should observe the following:
</p><p>1. Not talking with their wives about Jihad work.
</p><p>2. The members with security risks should not travel
<br>with their wives. A wife with an Islamic appearance
<br>(veil) attracts attention.

</b><u>Defining Security Plan</u>:&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is a set of coordinated, cohesive, and integrated measures&nbsp;&nbsp;
that are related to a certain activity and designed to confuse&nbsp;&nbsp;
and surprise the enemy, and if uncovered, to minimize the work&nbsp;&nbsp;
loss as much as possible.</pre>
[<i>This section of the Al-Qaida handbook describes what we would refer
to as 'deception plans.' The U.S. military makes deception plans integral
to operational plans, as described in Field Manual 90-2, <b>Battlefield
Deception</b> (which an interested reader will need to acquire from http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm90-2/toc.htm
rather than the Army's own digital library). It's entirely possible that
Al-Qaida is using elements of the U.S. military's approach, learned from
open source intelligence, or more recently through the U.S. and NATO involvement
in Bosnia.</i>]
<p><u>Importance of the Security Plan</u>:
</p><p>The work will be successful if Allah grants that. The more solid
<br>is the security plan, the more successful [the work] and the
<br>fewer the losses. The less solid the security plan, the less
<br>successful [the work] and the greater the losses.
</p><p>[<i>Deception is integral to the operational approach advocated by the
training manual. Sleepers rely upon well-backstopped (documented) cover
identities that provide the pretext (plausibility) for the operations.
The explicit security/deception plan here, however, is like the concept
of nested cover stories, what intelligence calls 'peeling the onion.' Taking
off one layer merely exposes the next layer, and so on. Robust cover stories
nest through multiple layers, with each layer providing a plausible interpretation
that appeals to the paradigms and prejudices (preconceived notions) of
those doing the peeling (analysts, journalists, politicians, the public,
etc.). Once provided with an explanation that appeals to them, an individual
will rarely keep peeling, and will in fact tend to discount or discard
evidence that is incompatible with such an interpretation. Truth, the reality
of the situation, remains buried under the layers, available yet undiscovered.
Al-Qaida cells use deception plans to manage and mitigate the consequences
of their operations--a good deception plan will misdirect and minimize
consequences, while a bad deception plan will allow the 'enemy' to make
sense of what is truly going on and take their own measures for management
and mitigation.</i>]
</p><p><u>Specifications of the Security Policy</u>: A number of conditions
<br>should be satisfied to help the security plan to succeed. These
<br>are: [It should be]
</p><p>A. realistic and based on fact so it would be credible to the
<br>enemy before and after the work.
</p><p>B. coordinated, integrated, cohesive, and accurate, without
<br>any gaps, to provide the enemy [the impression of] a
<br>continuous and linked chain of events.
</p><p>C. simple so that the members can assimilate it.
</p><p>D. creative.
</p><p>E. flexible.
</p><p>F. secretive.
</p><p>[<i>This is remarkably similar to a special operations approach. Item
A is a point from psychological operations (PSYOP)--'mobile truth,' or
a reinterpretation of events rather than a fabrication. This maps back
to the 'onion' approach to cover stories--the layers of misdirection are
matters of interpretation that lead to inaccurate or incomplete conclusions.
Outright falsehood would derail the deception, and leave exposed the existence
of deception planning. When people feel they already have the answers,
they cease asking meaningful questions (a rule of thumb in intelligence:
questions are where you ran out of answers; answers are where you ran out
of questions). To rely upon backstopping that will clearly be disproven
would lead the 'enemy' to perhaps reconsider and reinvestigate. Item B
is an attempt to create a robust set of alternatives by making them 'smooth'
rather than discontinuous. This is a curiosity that may indicate flaws
in the mindset of the author(s) of this section--professional intelligence
analysts and operators are paranoid by necessity, and anything that looks
'complete' is automatically suspect. No intelligence model is complete
(intelligence has its own version of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem), there
is no 'perfect' knowledge in the real world. This bit of tradecraft opts
for 'too much of a good thing must be better,' but looking at such a model
should make an intelligence professional break out in cold sweat. Items
C through F are good elements--simplicity makes the plan easier to understand
and implement (and the parallel, from the other side (those being deceived),
is that analysts tend to favor Ockham's Razor--the simplest explanation
is the one most likely to be true), creativity and novelty increase the
possibility for moral or material surprise, flexibility is essential in
dealing with the unexpected ("no plan survives contact"), and secrecy is
critical for plan success.</i>]
</p><p><u>The Method of Implementing the Security Plan</u>: There should be
a
<br>security plan for each activity that is subject to being
<br>uncovered by the enemy. For example, the brother who is charged
<br>with a certain mission might be arrested. It is, therefore,
<br>essential that a security plan be designed for him through which
<br>he will be able to deny any accusation. Likewise, for the group
<br>assigned a collective mission, there should be a security plan
<br>to which all members are committed. Each member would then find
<br>out , learn, and be trained in his role to ensure his assimilation
<br>of it.
</p><p>[<i>Discovery of an activity is a matter of 'when' and not 'if'--therefore
every activity needs to have a deception plan associated with it. The cover
identity should be chosen with pretext in mind--the identity should be
able to operate toward the desired goal without having to create a great
number of additional deception plans. The more complicated an operation
or the more at variance it is with the tolerance of the pretext of the
cover identity (plausibility), the more layers a deception plan needs to
create as insulation (see Churchill's comment: "In wartime, truth is so
precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.").
Such deception plans are actually simpler for the individual rather than
a group--group members will commonly present inconsistent stories, have
different cababilities of coping under pressure, etc. that can add up and
put the deception plan in jeopardy.</i>]

<br>for a group (important meeting). 3. Security plan for a group
<br>mission (assassination operation).

</p><p>1. <u>Example of a security plan for an individual mission</u>
<br>(training in Afghanistan):
</p><p><u>Prior to Departure</u>: Traveling through an airport, the brother
<br>might be subjected to interrogation. It is essential that he

</p><p><u>Transit Country (Return)</u>: The brother should be taught the
<br>answers to the following questions:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A. What were you doing in Pakistan?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Are you a Jihad fighter?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Do you belong to religious organizations in your country?

you
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; during your stay?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Whom did you visit in your group, and for how long?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Afghanistan?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I. What are their names?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; J. Who are the group commanders there [in Pakistan]? Where
do
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; they live and what do they do?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; K. What things do the commanders talk about?
</p><p>[<i>The specificity of this section is striking--training in Afghanistan,
with the travel route through Pakistan. Travel is not via a direct route
(similar to the tradecraft of the old PFLP). The 'prior to departure' section
are the sorts of questions one gets when departing from, for example, countries
in the Middle East (question B in particular is one heard more frequently
in the region--travel is rare, expensive, and unusual for certain socioeconomic
'classes'). The parenthetical comment regarding 'different degrees of interrogation'
is quite accurate--it ranges from simple questions (oddly, those with the
most Westernized appearance get the least questioning, when it would seem
a perfect opportunity for harassment) to being taken off to a secure room
for a more 'intimate' session. 'Transit' countries are part of a multi-stop
journey--good tradecraft is to completely 'break' the travel by switching
tickets and identities in the intermediate country (European countries
are incredibly easy to manage this in), but given the numbers of individuals
trained in Afghanistan, such tradecraft is probably reserved to key commanders
and core cadre of Al-Qaida. Proper selection of the transit country (one
with uniform respect for human and civil rights) means that such questions
are formalities, and as long as the pretext is plausible, no further investigation
will occur. This, incidentally, may well be one of the reason for the dramatic
proliferation and infiltration into non-governmental organizations (religious,
humanitarian, and aid) by Al-Qaida, since such organizations would provide
easy answers to all the posed questions, and interference by transit country
officials would be a serious issue. The 'arrival country' questions, destination
Pakistan, are laughable, and show just how little resistance Al-Qaida expected
in passing through Pakistan. Return through the 'transit' country becomes
slightly more complicated after Pakistan/Afghanistan. Al-Qaida cell members
are expected to be asked leading questions that would possibly expose their
affiliation (questions A &amp; B). Question C is both a back door leading
to potential Al-Qaida membership, but also of forensic use later on if
necessary. Note the emphasis in questions D through F are exactly about
transit--why 'them' (the transit country), who are you seeing (concerns
about the potential for local operations in the transit countries), and
how fast can they get rid of you. Getting through Pakistan into Afghanistan
is a greased chute, but getting through the transit countries appears just
as well expedited. The expected questions in 'return country' seem to imply
a 'break' that separates the movement pre-Pakistan from the post-Pakistan
travel--note the reference to the transit country, but not regarding Pakistan
or Afghanistan. These indications of Al-Qaida's travel tradecraft are inconsistent,
but demonstrate that this manual is far from complete, and that some sophistication
is present. The next section, 'when your travel to Pakistan is discovered'
reinforces that a break occurs, but also that Al-Qaida members assume that
somehow intelligence will discover the connection (contingency planning).
The questions are far from innocuous, immediately in pursuit of critical
intelligence data--what camp, trainers, weapons, training, etc. Then the
questions turn inward--Al-Qaida members are sleepers prepared for local
operations, and related details are desired: who sent you, who are your
contacts, what operations are you supposed to conduct, who else was trained,
who else may be in-country (local). Al-Qaida is then assumed to be pursued
as a line of questioning--commanders, locations, cover identities, areas
of interest, areas of operations, etc. This set of questions as well as
later material in the manual indicates clearly that sleepers are expected
to be examined carefully, possibly arrested and interrogated, but robust
deception planning will eventually return them to circulation, and operations.
The overall set of questions presented here indicate generally non-U.S.
countries of operation, and in fact, countries of operation in the Middle
East (the region that Al-Qaida considers of primary importance--the U.S.
is just a sideshow they need to deal with).</i>]
</p><p><u>An Example of a Security Plan for a Group Mission</u> (Important
<br>Meeting). The meeting is of two types:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A meeting held by those responsible for overt work.
That
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; [meeting] is held in many places (mosque, apartment,...)
</p><p>[<i>Note that a mosque is an accepted place for a meeting--no separation
in Islam between 'spiritual and secular' matters, a complicating factor
for the vast majority of moslems.</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-60 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; B. A meeting held by those responsible for covert work.
</p><p>For that [meeting],great effort on our part should be
<br>exercised to ensure its safety. We shall discuss that meeting
<br>and what makes it secure from enemies spies.
</p><p>The security plan for that meeting is divided into several
<br>stages:
</p><p>A. Before the meeting, B. The meeting location, C. During the
<br>meeting, D. After the conclusion of meeting, E. In case security
<br>personnel storm the meeting place and capture one of the
<br>members.
</p><p>A. <u>Before the meeting</u>: Here the meeting for covert work is
<br>divided into:
</p><p><u>Meeting in a Stationary Location</u>: A meeting where more than
<br>three members gather to discuss a plan or prepare for an activity.
</p><p><u>Mobile Meeting (Encounter)</u>:A meeting among a small number
<br>of members, not more than three, to inform [one another] of
<br>a certain issue.
</p><p><u>Security Measures Necessary Prior to the Stationary Meeting</u>:
</p><p>1. Establishing a plan suitable for the members if any of
<br>them is arrested. It consists of:
</p><p>Who is the owner of the apartment?&nbsp; What was discussed in the
<br>meeting?&nbsp; Who was with you?&nbsp; What was agreed upon?
</p><p>2. Specifying the timing of the meeting in such a way as not
<br>to raise suspicion of the members' movements.
</p><p>3. Not allowing a long period of time between specifying the
<br>meeting time and the meeting itself.
</p><p>4. Securing the meeting location and the routes leading
<br>to it by the following:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Ensuring the security status via telephone.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-61 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Assigning members to monitor the place
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; before and during the meeting.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Planting a member close to the nearest enemy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; security point (police station, security
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; administration) to communicate the first
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; sight of security movement.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Posting an armed guard to stop any attack
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; and to give those meeting a chance to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; escape.
</p><p>5. Specifying what would happen in the event the
<br>police storm the place.
</p><p>6. Those members going to the meeting should
<br>consider the following:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Ensuring that the enemy is not behind them
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; while on the way to the meeting place.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Not heading directly to the meeting place
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; but through secondary places.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Not going to the meeting place as a group
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; but individually, with time gaps between
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; them.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. The clothing and appearance should be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for the meeting place.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. If the brother uses public transportation,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; he should alight before or after the meeting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; location. In case he has a private car, he
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; should park it in a secure place not near
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the location that allows him to maneuver
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; quickly at any moment.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Verifying the proper cover for the documents
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; he has with him.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; g. If a member is armed, he should make sure
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; that the weapon is in good working
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; condition.
</p><p><u>Necessary Security Measures Prior to the Mobile Meeting</u>: When
a
<br>brother goes to a certain meeting (mobilemeeting), he should
<br>review these things:
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-62 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Is he sure that the enemy is not behind him nor
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; at the meeting place?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Who will meet him?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Is there anything that might raise suspicion?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Is this the first appointment or the second
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; (alternative,changed)?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Does he know the meeting place in detail?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Are his appearance and clothing suitable for the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; location where he will stand [meet]?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Is his weapon in good working condition?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; h. What is the alternative for each action?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Not going directly to the person whom he would
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; like to meet, Verifying the person's appearance
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; and features.
</p><p>B. <u>The Stationary Meeting Location</u>: It is necessary that it
<br>have special characteristics to confront any danger to the
<br>meeting members:
</p><p>1. Location-wise, it should be in the middle of a group
<br>of houses, not at the beginning.
</p><p>2. Having many routes leading to that location. That
<br>would assist entering and exiting in many ways.
</p><p>Consequently, it makes surrounding the place difficult
<br>and facilitates escaping from danger.
</p><p>3. The location should not be close to suspicious
<br>locations ([where] individuals or establishments work
<br>with the security [apparatus]).
</p><p>4. It is preferable that the apartment be on the ground
<br>floor and have a telephone.
</p><p><u>The Mobile Meeting Location (Encounter)</u>:
</p><p>1. The meeting location should be at the intersection of
<br>many roads where it is easy to come, go, and flee.
</p><p>2. <i>[No text.]</i>
</p><p>[<i>If this bullet needed to be filled in, the probable 'missing' element
is the ability to observe clearly--fields of vision, fields of fire--while
enjoying some sort of cover and concealment if necessary.</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-63 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>3. The meeting should be held far from places where it is
<br>believed some of whose elements deal with the security
<br>apparatus (coffee shops).
</p><p>4. The place should not be crowded because that allows
<br>security personnel to go undetected.
</p><p>5. It is necessary to have alternative locations and
<br>times. That would make it difficult for security&nbsp; personnel
<br>to monitor the place.
</p><p>B. <u>During the Meeting</u>: The following should be observed:
</p><p>[<i>If you're keeping track, this is a bulleting error--it should actually
be C (which cascades and causes the gap later).</i>]
</p><p>1. Establishing a security plan that consists of the
<br>following:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Proper cover for the members' presence (students,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; for example, it is necessary to have books,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; notebooks,...)
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Verifying that personal documents match the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; agreed-upon cover.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Not having written direction to the meeting&nbsp; place.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; If that is necessary, it should be coded.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Not having or leaving food or anything else that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; would reveal the presence of many people.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Surrounding the place with barb wire. That
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; depends on the importance of the meeting and if
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; there are items that cannot be carried during
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; escape.
</p><p>C. <u>After the Conclusion of the Meeting</u>:
</p><p>1. Departing singly or in pairs, depending on the number
<br>of members present.
</p><p>2. Not heading directly onto main roads but to secondary
<br>ones.
</p><p>3. Not speaking about what was discussed in the meeting,
<br>during or after departure.
</p><p>4. Removing all observers after the members depart.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-64 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>5. Not leaving anything that would lead [to the fact that]
<br>there was anyone there except the owner.
</p><p><i>[D. not used.]</i>
</p><p>E. <u>Raiding and capturing one of the members</u>.
</p><p>1. Establishing a plan to repel the attack, which
<br>consists of the following:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Who will engage the enemy with bullets?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Who will flee with the important
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; documents and who will burn the rest?
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Not heading directly to other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; organization locations.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Specifying the escape roads and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Streets.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. If the place is surrounded by barb
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; wire, make sure all members have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; left.
</p><p>In case an individual is caught, the following should be done:
<br>Executing what was agreed upon with the brother in the
<br>security plan.
</p><p>If the brother has important work position (commander,one
<br>who knows the arsenal locations, ...), whatever is necessary
<br>should be done before the enemy discovers anything.
</p><p>Instruct all members not to go to the meeting location.
</p><p>Inform all members of the telephone number of that
<br>apartment in order to mislead the enemy.
</p><p>[<i>This section covers material discussed previously, but again, more
pro-actively, more about what should be done rather than what shouldn't,
and clearly a more experienced voice. Mobile meetings, parenthetically
an 'encounter,' is 'spot' contact--more than a brush pass, but not intended
to seem more than a coincidental gathering. Stable meetings require a more
detailed deception plan, strict adherence to tradecraft, and active security
measures (security alerts, guards, tripwire personnel, armed resistance
(playing 'Horatius at the bridge'); also specified are careful entry and
exit protocols, pretexting and backstopped cover identities, even armed
cell members. Preparation for a mobile meeting focuses on avoiding or evading
surveillance, knowing the location and meeting parties, a good pretext,
fall-back meeting arrangements, checking a weapon. Meeting location tradecraft
is reiterated from the earlier material. Meeting tradecraft relies on pretext
and cover identities, although item e is curious (barbed wire isn't suspicious?).
Post-meeting exit protocol is fairly standard tradecraft, except for item
4--observers of meetings would, because of security and compartmentalization
reasons, be superior in the hierarchy of the organization (higher level
commanders, core cadre). This indicates that 'spot checking' probably occurs
in the organization--checking on commanders, cells, progress, making personal
assessments that are communicated back to the core of the organization.
Section E provides a few clues about the function of the organization:
armed resistance is an option (rather than relying upon the deception plan
alone), roles in the organization are clear (who fights, who runs, who
stays behind to take care of security matters), exfiltration protocol is
explicit. Damage control efforts are to be undertaken immediately--acknowledgement
that captured personnel can resist supplying information for a limited
time (although how damage control efforts can be taken by cell members,
given reservation of critical information to commanders, is questionable).
'Blown' locations and members are then considered for ways to utilize them
in future deception plans.</i>]

<br>an important person)<sup>3</sup>: Assassination is an operation of
<br>military means and basic security. Therefore, it is essential
<br>that the commanders who establish plans related to assassination
<br>give attention to two issues:
</p><p>____________________
</p><p>[3] It is possible to also say "kidnaping an important person."
<br>All security measures and arrangements in assassination
<br>and kidnaping are the same.
</p><p>[<i>Assassination, or 'leadership-based targeting,' is mentioned as
an operation against the 'enemy' but also in dealing with internal security
matters--losing the trust of Al-Qaida is dealt with harshly (both as a
practical matter and as an 'object lesson' to others in the organization).
It is blatantly false that security measures and arrangements for assassination
and kidnapping operations are the same--professional execution of either
sort of operation require very different tradecraft.</i>]
</p><p><u>First Issue</u>: The importance of establishing a careful,
<br>systematic, and solid security plan to hide the operation from
<br>the enemy until the time of its execution, which would minimize
<br>the losses in case the executing party is discovered.
</p><p>[<i>Two different but complimentary plans need to be assembled--operations
security (OPSEC) and deception (consequence management). Note that utilization
of the same tradecraft for kidnapping and assassination may be part of
the deception plan--claiming, in the event of capture, that kidnapping
was the intended course of action.</i>]
</p><p><u>Second Issue</u>: The importance of establishing a tactical plan
for
<br>the assassination operation that consists of the operational
<br>factors themselves (members,weapons, hiding places ...) and
<br>factors of the operation (time,place). In this example, we
<br>shall explain in detail the part related to the security plan.
</p><p>The part related to operational tactics will be explained in
<br>the lesson on special operational tactics.
</p><p>Security Plan for the Assassination Operation: The security plan
<br>must take into account the following matters:
</p><p>A. <u>The Commander</u>: The security apparatus should not know
<br>his whereabouts and movements. All security measures and
<br>arrangements related to members of the Military Organization
<br>(soldiers,commanders) apply to him.
</p><p>B. <u>The Members</u>:
</p><p>1. They are elements who are selected from various provinces
<br>and are suitable for the operation.
</p><p>2. During the selection process, members should not
<br>know one another. They should not know the original planners
<br>of the operation. In case they&nbsp; do, the&nbsp; commander should
be
<br>notified. He then should modify the plan.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-66 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>3. They should be distributed as small groups (3
<br>members) in apartments that are not known except to
<br>their proprietors. They should also be given field
<br>names.
</p><p>4. During the selection process, consider whether their
<br>absence from their families and jobs would clearly attract
<br>attention. We also apply to them all security measures
<br>related to the Organization's individuals (soldiers).
</p><p>[<i>Commanders have a greater tradecraft burden, and should be more
diligent to a higher standard than ordinary cell members. Selection of
cell members by provinces is for compatibility reasons, but also because
it may have operational significance (likely for operations in the Middle
East or related to targets from the region--kidnapping or the threat of
assassination is an old method of extorting financial support from wealthy
individuals and families). Unit cohesion appears to be sacrificed in favor
of security--lack of prior contact of cell members (particularly training)
and isolation of cells. Operations security is monitored, protecting identification
of planners and commanders by immediate willingness to change plans. By
'field names' it should be assumed cover identities and backstopping that
fit with the pretext necessary to support the deception plan. Consideration
of 'private lives' impacting on operations security indicates the scope
of selection in sleeper agents--while travel and long absence because of
cover identity might go without notice, members are not selected with their
private lives as a contributing factor.</i>]
</p><p>C. <u>Method of Operating</u>:
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The matters of arming and financing should not be
<br>known by anyone except the commander.
</p><p>2. The apartments should not be rented under real names.
<br>They [the apartments] should undergo all security measures
<br>related to the Military Organization's camps.
</p><p>3. Prior to executing an operation, falsified documents
<br>should be prepared for the participating individuals.
</p><p>4. The documents related to the operation should be.
<br>hidden in a secure place and burned immediately after
<br>the operation, and traces of the fire should be removed.
</p><p>5. The means of communication between the operation commander
<br>and the participating brothers should be established.
</p><p>6. Prior to the operation, apartments should be prepared to
<br>hide the brothers participating in it. These apartments
<br>should not be known except to the commander and his soldiers.
</p><p>7. Reliable transportation means must be made available. It
<br>is essential that prior to the operation, these means are
<br>checked and properly maintained.
</p><p>[<i>Reiteration of prior tradecraft discussions, albeit slightly more
direct. Item 1 again asserts compartmentalization, with critical information
reserved to commanders (requiring 'damage control' to occur from a hierarchically-superior
organizational element, and orphaning the cell unless the organization
wishes to reestablish control). Item 5 is curiously non-specific, leaving
wide latitude.</i>]
</p><p>D. <u>Interrogation and Investigation</u>: Prior to executing an
<br>operation, the commander should instruct his soldiers on
<br>what to say if they are captured. He should explain that
<br>more than once, in order to ensure that they have
<br>assimilated it. They should, in turn, explain it back to
<br>the commander. The commander should also sit with each of
<br>them individually (and go over] the agreed-upon matters
<br>that would be brought up during the interrogation:
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-67 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>1. The one who conceived, planned, and executed this operation
<br>was a brother who has a record of those matters with the
<br>enemy.
</p><p>2. During the interrogation, each brother would mention a
<br>story that suits his personal status and the province of
<br>his residence. The story should be agreed upon with the
<br>commander.
</p><p>3. Each brother who is subjected to interrogation and torture,
<br>should state all that he agreed upon with the commander and
<br>not deviate from it. Coordination should be maintained
<br>with all brothers connected to the operation.
</p><p>Note: The fictitious brother who the brothers say conceived,
<br>planned, trained, and executed the operation, should be sent
<br>away on a journey [outside the country].
</p><p>[<i>Management of the deception plan and preparation of cell members
is mild in comparison to approaches such as SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance,
Escape). Note the 'onion' approach in the deception plan. Item 1 attributes
the operation to an individual (or one would presume, to further confuse
the issue, an organization of non-State actors or State sponsor not connected
to Al-Qaida) that the target is willing to accept (catering to preconceptions).
Items 2 &amp; 3 are reinforcement to stick to the cover identity and deception
plan. The 'note' is interesting in its contradictions (how can a fictitious
'brother' be sent anywhere? this may be a translation error)--why attribute
the operation to an individual in the organization? Al-Qaida is 'notorious'
for not claiming formal responsibility for attacks, so this indicates that
various trial transcripts related to Al-Qaida operations may require reanalysis
in light of increasing knowledge of their tradecraft and deception planning
approach.</i>]

</p><p><u>Definition of Espionage</u><sup>5</sup>: It is the covert search
for and
<br>examination of the enemy's news and information for the purpose
<br>of using them when a plan is devised. In [the book titled]
<br>"Nile AI-Aoutar wa Fath Al-Bari," [it is said that] the spy is
<br>called an eye because his work is through his eyes, or because
<br>of his excessive and preoccupation with observation, as if all
<br>his being is an eye.
</p><p>____________________
</p><p>[5] For details, refer to <u>The Spying Journal: Religious Duty</u>
<br><u>and Human Necessity</u>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><u>Espionage in the era of the prophet - Allah bless and keep him -</u>
<br><u>and his honored companions</u>: The prophet - Allah bless and keep
<br>him - used informants in most of his attacks. As Abou Soufian's
<br>caravan, that was coming from Damascus, was approaching, the
<br>prophet - Allah bless and keep him - wanted to know the
<br>caravan's destination. While the prophet was in Madina, he sent
<br>Talha Ibn Obaidallah and Said Ibn Zeid to the Damascus route to
<br>gather information about the caravan. On their way back to
<br>Madina, and at the conclusion of the Badr battle, they met the
<br>prophet - Allah bless and keep him - in Terban, as he was
<br>descending from Badr to take Madina. [Though] they did not
<br>participate in the battle, they nevertheless got their share
<br>of the [spoils].
</p><p>In his attacks, the prophet - Allah bless and keep him - would
<br>find out the enemy's intention. In the Hodaibiya [battle] days,
<br>though he did not want war, he exercised caution by sending a
<br>special 40-man reconnaissance group, headed by A'kkasha Ibn
<br>Mohsen Al-Azda. One of that group forerunners found a man who
<br>led them to the enemy's livestock. They captured 200 camels
<br>from that livestock and brought them to Madina.
</p><p>[<i>This story is recounted in <b>The Life of Mahomet</b> in Chapter
12: http://answering-islam.org/Books/Muir/Life3/chap12.htm</i> ]
</p><p>The prophet - Allah bless and keep him - had local informants in
<br>Mecca who told him everything, big and small, that might harm
<br>the Muslims' welfare. Among those [enemies] were his uncle Al-
<br>Abbas Ibn Abd Al-Mutlib, and Bashir Ibn Soufian Al-Atki. Al-
<br>Khulafa Arrashidun [Mohammed's successors] advised their
<br>commanders about the importance of using scouts and informants
<br>to learn theenemy's secrets. Abou Bakr Al-Siddik - may Allah
<br>be pleased with him - said to his commander Amro Ibn AI-A'ss -
<br>may Allah be pleased with him -, "Send your informants to bring
<br>you Abou Obeida's news. If he is victorious over his enemy,
<br>then you fight those that are in Palestine. If he needs
<br>soldiers, then dispatch one battalion after another for him.''
</p><p>[<i>See http://answering-islam.org/Books/Muir/Life3/chap11.htm for supplemental
perspective.</i>]
</p><p>Omar Ibn Al-Khattab - may Allah be pleased with him - advised
<br>his commander Saad Ibn Abou Wakkas - may Allah be pleased with
<br>him - saying, "If you step foot on your enemies' land, get spies
<br>for them. Choose those whom you count on for their truthfulness
</p><p><i>[Page break.]</i>
</p><p>and advice, whether Arabs or inhabitants of that land. Liars'
<br>accounts would not benefit you, even if some of them were true;
<br>the deceiver is a spy against you and not for you." Khaled Ibn
<br>Al-Walid - may Allah be pleased with him - used to take
<br>informants and spies with him in each of his wars against the
<br>Christian Orthodox. He chose them carefully and treated them well.
</p><p><u>Principle of Moslems Spying on their Enemies</u>: Spying on the
<br>enemy is permitted and it may even be a duty in the case of war
<br>between Moslems and others. Winning the battle is dependent on
<br>knowing the enemy's secrets, movements, and plans. The prophet
<br>- Allah bless and keep him - used that method. He would send
<br>spies and informants. Perhaps, he - Allah bless and keep him -
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-77 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>even went himself as in the major Badr attack. AI-Khulafa
<br>Arrashidun [Mohammed's successors] also ordered it [spying].
<br>Since Islam is superior to all human conditions and earthly
<br>religions, it permits spying for itself but not for others.
</p><p>Majestic Allah says, "Not equal are the companions of the fire
<br>and the companions of the garden," and the prophet says, "Islam
<br>is supreme and there is nothing above it." Islam, therefore,
<br>fights so the word of Allah can become supreme. Others fight
<br>for worldly gains and lowly and inferior goals.
</p><p><u>An Important Question</u>: How can a Muslim spy live among enemies
<br>if he maintains his Islamic characteristics? How can he perform
<br>his duties to Allah and not want to appear Muslim?
</p><p>Concerning the issue of clothing and appearance (appearance of
<br>true religion), Ibn Taimia - may Allah have mercy on him - said,
<br>"If a Muslim is in a combat or godless area, he is not obligated
<br>to have a different appearance from [those around him]. The
<br>[Muslim] man may prefer or even be obligated to look like them,
<br>provided his action brings a religious benefit of preaching to
<br>them, learning their secrets and informing Muslims, preventing
<br>their harm, or some other beneficial goal."
</p><p>Resembling the polytheist in religious appearance is a kind of
<br>"necessity permits the forbidden" even though they [forbidden
<br>acts] are basically prohibited. As for the visible duties, like
<br>fasting and praying, he can fast by using any justification not
<br>to eat with them [polytheist]. As for prayer, the book (Al-
<br>Manhaj Al-Haraki Lissira Al-Nabawiya) quotes Al-Bakhari that "he
<br>[the Moslem] may combine the noon and afternoon [prayers],
<br>sunset and evening [prayers]. That is based on the fact that
<br>the prophet - Allah bless and keep him - combined [prayers] in
<br>Madina without fear or hesitation."
</p><p>[<i>Note that Ibn Taimia and Ahmed Ibn Hanbal are two of the sources
that Wahhabism will defer to outside the Qur'an or Traditions.</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-78 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>Though scholars have disagreed about the interpretation of that
<br>tradition, it is possible - though Allah knows best - that the
<br>Moslem spy combines [prayers]. It is noted, however, that it
<br>is forbidden to do the unlawful, such as drinking wine or
<br>fornicating. There is nothing that permits those<sup>6</sup>.

</p><p>[<i>An Egyptian periodical, see: http://www.almurabeton.org/</i> ]
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><u>Guidelines for Beating and Killing Hostages</u>: Religious scholars
<br>have permitted beating. They use a tradition explained in Imam
<br>Mosallem's manuscript, who quotes Thabit Ibn Ans that Allah's
<br>prophet - Allah bless and keep him - sought counsel when he was
<br>informed about Abou Soufian's arrival. Abou Bakr and Omar
<br>spoke, yet he [the prophet] did not listen. Saad Ibn Ibada
<br>said, "Do you want us, O Allah's prophet, who controls my life?
</p><p>If you order us to subdue the camel we would do it, or beat and
<br>follow them to Al-Ghimad lakes (5-day trip beyond Mecca), we
<br>would do it, too." The prophet - Allah bless and keep him -
<br>called on the people, who then descended on Badr. They were met
<br>by Kureish camels carrying water. Among their takers was a
<br>young black [slave] man belonging to the Al-Hajjaj clan. They
<br>took him [as hostage]. The companions of the prophet - Allah
<br>bless and keep him - started asking him about Abou Sofian and
<br>his companions. He first said, "I know nothing about Abou
<br>Soufian but I know about Abou Jahl, Atba, Sheiba, and Omaya Ibn
<br>Khalaf." But when they beat him he said, “O yes, I will tell
<br>you. This is the news of Abou Soufian...” Meanwhile, the
<br>prophet - Allah bless and
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-79 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>keep him -, who was praying, started to depart saying, "Strike
<br>him if he tells you the truth and release him if he lies." Then
<br>he said, "That is the death of someone [the hostage]." He said
<br>that in the presence of his companions and while moving his
<br>hand on the ground.
</p><p>In this tradition, we find permission to interrogate the hostage
<br>for the purpose of obtaining information. It is permitted to
<br>strike the nonbeliever who has no covenant until he reveals the
<br>news, information, and secrets of his people.
</p><p>The religious scholars have also permitted the killing of a hostage
<br>if he insists on withholding information from Moslems. They
<br>permitted his killing so that he would not inform his people of
<br>what he learned about the Muslim condition, number, and secrets.
</p><p>In the Honein attack, after one of the spies learned about the
<br>Muslims kindness and weakness then fled, the prophet - Allah
<br>bless and keep him - permitted [shedding] his blood and said,
<br>"Find and kill him." Salma Ibn Al-Akwaa followed, caught, and
<br>killed him.
</p><p>The scholars have also permitted the exchange of hostages for
<br>&nbsp;money, services, and expertise, as well as secrets of the enemy’s
<br>army, plans, and numbers. After the Badr attack, the prophet -
<br>Allah bless and keep him - showed favor to some hostages, like
<br>the poet Abou Izza, by exchanging most of them for money. The
<br>rest were released for providing services and expertise to the
<br>Muslims<sup>7</sup>.

</p><p>2. Information about the enemy's intention provides early
<br>warning signs for the command, which in turn makes

</p><p>3. Information benefits the Organization's command by
<br>providing information about the enemy's strengths and

</p><p>General Mahmoud Sheet Khattab said, "The nation that wants to
<br>achieve victory over its enemy must know that enemy very well.
<br>It also must know the site of the battle in detail. Those who
<br>fight an enemy that they do not know, do not win because a
<br>successful military plan must be built on clear and trustworthy
<br>information. The commander who fights an enemy and does not
<br>know his strength (number and materiel) is blind and destined to
<br>fail and fall."

</p><p><u>Information Sources</u>: Any organization that desires to raise the

<br>as possible about the enemy. Information has two sources:
</p><p>1. <u>Public Source</u>: Using this public source openly and without
<br>resorting to illegal means, it is possible to gather at
<br>least 80% of information about the enemy. The percentage

<b>UK/BM-81 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>varies depending on the government's policy on freedom of
<br>the press and publication. It is possible to gather
<br>information through newspapers, magazines, books,
<br>periodicals, official publications, and enemy broadcasts.
</p><p>Attention should also be given to the opinion, comments,
<br>and jokes of common people.
</p><p>[<i>With modern open source intelligence (OSINT), it is possible to
develop 80-95% of the operational intelligence necessary, against targets
in Westernized countries. More of this is discussed in Hunting the Sleepers,
but it's important to confirm here that Al-Qaida uses the openness of the
West (lower information acquisition costs) against itself. The attention
to 'softer' content--psychology, editorial, opinion, emotion, sentiment--is
to assess the effect of operations and to manage psychological operations.</i>]
</p><p>Truman, a past American President, said, "We attribute our
<br>great advance to our press, because it gives America's
<br>enemies the capability of learning what we have not
<br>officially publicized about our plans and even our
<br>establishments.”
</p><p>In 1954, Allan Dulles [PH],Director of American
<br>Intelligence [CIA], said, "I am ready to pay any amount of
<br>money to obtain information about the Soviet Union, even as
<br>little as what the Soviet Union obtains by simply reading
<br>American newspapers."
</p><p>The one gathering public information should be a regular
<br>person (trained college graduate) who examines primary
<br>sources of information published by the enemy (newspapers,
<br>magazines, radio, TV, etc.). He should search for
<br>information directly related to the topic in question.
</p><p>The one gathering information with this public method is
<br>not exposed to any danger whatsoever. Any brother can
<br>gather information from those aforementioned sources. We
<br>cannot label that brother a "Moslem Spy" because he does
<br>not make any effort to obtain unpublished and covert
<br>information.

</p><p>G. Surveillance, spying, and observation
</p><p>[<i>This is discussed in greater detail in the next section--redundancy,
bad editing, indications of a composite document, all are likely contributing
factors. Item A is human intelligence (HUMINT), a particularly risky form
of espionage. Items B, C, and G are largely technical intelligence. Items
D and F imply kidnapping of personnel with the requisite knowledge--risky,
potentially exposing the potential operations, but certainly forewarning
the 'enemy' of Al-Qaida activity. Item E curiously omits 'dumpster diving,'
likely on the assumption that documents of interest to Al-Qaida would be
shredded or burned rather than thrown into the trash; burglary of such
documents is difficult and risky under such circumstances as well.</i>]
</p><p><u>Information Gathering Using Public Means</u>:
</p><p>A. <u>Newspapers, Magazines,and Official and Party Publications</u>:
</p><p>In order to gather enemy information, the Military
<br>Organization can use means such as magazines, publications,
<br>periodicals, and official printed matter. Through these
<br>means, it is possible to learn about major government
<br>events and about the news, meetings, and travel of
<br>Presidents, ministers, and commanders. Information may be:
</p><p>1. Names and photographs of important government
<br>personalities, police commanders, and security
<br>leaders.
</p><p>2. Published meetings. Through these, one can learn
<br>about major decisions and topics being discussed.
</p><p>3. Future meeting plans.
</p><p>4. Present and future enemy capabilities through current
<br>photographs of projects and strategic sites or through
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>UK/BM-83 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>meetings with top officials.
</p><p>5. Beneficial news about the enemy's diplomacy and its
<br>present and future plans.
</p><p>6. Tourism news and the arrival times of foreign tourist
<br>groups.
</p><p>7. Advertisements about apartments for rent, vacant
<br>positions, or anything else that is useful.
</p><p>8. Advertisements about new and used car lots. These may
<br>be used in assassination, kidnaping, and overthrowing
<br>the government.
</p><p>9. Learning the enemy position on current Islamic issues
<br>(veil,beard, dedication, Jihad, ...).
</p><p>B. <u>Radio and Television</u>: The Military organization can use
<br>these important public sources to gather information all
<br>day and night. The importance of these means is explained
<br>below.
</p><p>1. Visual and audible news help the Organization to
<br>determine its present and future plans.
</p><p>2. Interviews may help to identify the government policy
<br>and its general directives.
</p><p>3. Spotting the appearance of those who occupy high
<br>positions.
</p><p>4. Learning the prevailing information diplomacy and its
<br>position on contemporary issues.
</p><p>5. Learning about the interior of important government
<br>places and establishments during their opening
<br>ceremonies or through advertisements.
</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned, [attention should be given]
<br>to newspapers, magazines, and the public's comments and jokes.
</p><p>[<i>Note that much of the material indicated here is rapidly perishable,
what is known as 'current reporting.' Again, open media provide much of
intelligence value, particularly for skilled analysts. Item A8 is amusing,
likely unintentionally so due to the phrasing of the translation (used
cars for operations, but including 'overthrowing the government' should
be enough to get a chuckle out of most readers, imagining decades of rust
and poor repair on a vehicle used to attack seats of government).</i>]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) INFORMATION-GATHERING USING COVERT METHODS&nbsp;&nbsp;



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>UK/BM-85 TRANSLATION&nbsp;&nbsp;

</b><u>Information needed through covert means</u>: Information needed&nbsp;
to&nbsp; be gathered through covert means is of only two types:&nbsp;&nbsp;

<u>First</u>: Information about government personnel, officers,&nbsp;&nbsp;
important personalities, and all matters related to those&nbsp;&nbsp;
(residence,work place, times of leaving and returning, wives&nbsp;&nbsp;
and children, places visited)&nbsp;&nbsp;

<u>Second</u>: Information about strategic buildings, important
establishments, and military bases. Examples are important
ministries such as those of Defense and Internal Security,
airports, seaports, land border points, embassies, and&nbsp;
radio and TV stations.</pre>

<p><br>[<i>Again, the first point is related to 'leadership-based attacks,'
and the second point is regarding potential targets (leadership, economic,
symbolic).</i>]
</p><p><u>General security measures that should be taken by the person</u>
<br><u>gathering information</u>: During the process of gathering
<br>information, whether about governing personalities or
<br>establishments, the person doing the gathering must take the
<br>following security measures:
</p><p>1. Performing the exercises to detect surveillance while
<br>executing the mission. These exercises are not well
<br>defined, but are dependent on the time, place, and the
<br>ability to be creative. These exercises include the
<br>following:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Walking down a dead-end street and observing who is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; walking behind you. Beware of traps.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Casually dropping something out of your pocket and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; observing who will pick it up.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Walking fast then stopping suddenly at a corner and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; observing who will be affected.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Stopping in front of store windows and observing who
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; is watching you.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Getting on a bus and then getting off after it departs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; and observing who will be affected.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-86 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Agreeing with one of your brothers to look for whoever
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; is watching you.
</p><p>[<i>Note that these elements of tradecraft miss certain approaches entirely
(item a would miss 'forward tailing' and many of the items would miss a
'checkpoint' approach rather than an active tail. Good tailing operations
utilize multiple skilled personnel and chase vehicles. While this tradecraft
would suffice against amateurs, it provides little aid regarding professional
surveillance.</i>]
</p><p>2. When receiving the gathered information, let the informants
<br>travel as far as possible from their place of residence and
<br>yours. Let each of them get there using secondary roads,
<br>preferably at night.
</p><p>[<i>This shifts the travel risk onto the human source, and allows the
intelligence officer (in this case, probably a cell commander) to select
and secure the location. Note that the circumstances of the meeting may
present a problem for the source--remote, little pretext to cover the trip,
suspicious timing.</i>]
</p><p>3. Gather what information you can without emphasizing any
<br>particular part. Do not rush or show urgency because your
<br>excitement may uncover you and the degree of importance of
<br>the information.
</p><p>[<i>Questions map the space of what is known, and what is not known;
questions also map the 'interest' space--what is desired to be known. The
intelligence officer needs to maintain 'objectivity' when eliciting information
for two purposes--protecting his own organization's security and interests,
and to be make the best use of the source. A source with knowledge of an
intelligence officer's interests may learn too much about the officer's
organization (a risk in the event of informers, turned assets, or interrogation
if apprehended), or may decide to 'sweeten' the information flow (ignoring
other areas of information that may be important, creating information
to meet the level of interest, focusing on such information to make it
seem more important, or changing behavior to acquire more information in
that category).</i>]
</p><p>4. Avoid anything that reveals your identity quickly. Do not
<br>attempt to be too creative or inventive. Remember what
<br>Taliran [PHI said to his political emissaries, "Do not be
<br>anxious.”
</p><p>[<i>If this pertains to the relationship with a human asset, establishing
a relationship first and building up trust between the officer and the
asset is essential. Affiliation is a tricky issue. 'False flag' operations
are still common in intelligence--leading the source to think that the
officer is affiliated with a different organization (in the event a source
turns or is apprehended) to elicit information. False flag operations can
utilize groups in opposition to the real organization (Al-Qaida could represent
itself as some form of law enforcement, or Mossad) to get information a
source would never provide to the real organization itself; false flags
can also be of similar organizational types (another Islamic group) but
not your own, for deception and misdirection purposes. Revealing real affiliation
(if ever done at all) runs a risk of alienating a source, even after a
strong relationship has been established. Being too creative or inventive
in cover identity means running the risk of not being able to support the
identity--backstopping, in behavior, etc.</i>]
</p><p>5. Move slowly and travel a great distance. The one who
<br>is successful in gathering information is the one who is not
<br>known or conspicuous.
</p><p>[<i>Casual violation of traffic regulations are a risk not worth the
return. Surveillance of targets or locations may be observed; one of the
'indicators' of being under surveillance is sighting reoccuring individuals,
thus the advice to not be 'known' and to be inconspicuous (not attracting
attention or sticking in someone's memory). The useful techniques of fitting
into a pretext (looking like a tourist at appropriate locations) or falling
into a category (once categorized, an operator attracts much less scrutiny--if
the category is a harmless one) are not explicitly advised. In some countries,
Al-Qaida operators may blend into the indigenous population or a common
sub-group, but in others they may automatically be suspect.</i>]
</p><p>6. Do not accept events at their face value. Do not overlook
<br>a quick friendship or an apparent dispute. Evaluate the
<br>importance of events and do not judge them by their
<br>appearance.
</p><p>[<i>Interestingly, this is phrased in a neutral fashion rather than
being explicit as to the advantages and disadvantages that may be encountered.
Sudden friendships may be suspicious (an asset from an intelligence agency
or law enforcement 'getting close' to target of interest, the operator),
but they can also be real and of great benefit. Disputes can similarly
be opportunities--relationships 'in flux' can be rearranged to the benefit
of the operator--or indications of risk (a lure, or part of someone else's
deception operation). "Paranoia is our profession" is a mantra for intelligence
professionals, no matter what their affiliation.</i>]
</p><p>7. Do not speak vaguely or act mysteriously except when
<br>wanting to get a "blabber mouth" to talk about what he
<br>knows.
</p><p>[<i>An indication of a good understanding of some aspects of the psychology
of human assets. Some assets feel unappreciated (or underappreciated) and
are looking for a 'sympathetic ear'--give them an opportunity to talk and
they'll take it. For others, the ego-involvement is considerable, so the
officer being 'vague' or 'mysterious' is interpreted as a lower level of
understanding, and the opportunity for the asset to demonstrate how much
they know. More difficult assets will only discuss a matter if they feel
that the officer already knows about it, or if they feel a need to correct
a misconception. Running a human asset is more an art than a science.</i>]
</p><p>8. Carry personal credentials and know all their contents.
</p><p>[<i>Essential for the operator to know the details of the cover identity,
that the cover identity matches the pretext of being in a location or involved
in an activity, and that the operator can withstand a 'normal' level of
background checking and interrogation.</i>]
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-87 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>9. Prior to collecting the information, make sure that all
<br>necessities related to the mission, especially money, are
<br>ready.
</p><p>[<i>The comment in the U.S. military is "proper planning and preparation
prevent piss-poor performance," a sentiment that Al-Qaida obviously shares.</i>]
</p><p>10. Study the area where information-gathering takes place
<br>carefully: Open and closed streets, residents' customs,
<br>ways of dressing, and accent.
</p><p>[<i>A reminder that knowing an area is essential in blending in (although
knowing an area implies a certain amount of exposure to it--and exposure
to others while doing it). Knowing streets is important for operational
purposes, as well as escape and evasion.</i>]
</p><p>11. It is not permitted to carry any weapons during the
<br>information-gathering process.
</p><p>[<i>Very few cover identities and pretexts can withstand the casual
search turning up a weapon--a situation that the operator could have talked
his way out of, or would have been released from custody eventually for
lack of cause, becomes incredibly complicated or impossible once a weapon
is involved. Criminal penalties are much greater with involvement of a
weapon (trespassing, which can plausibly be an accident, is no longer a
simple affair if a knife or gun is found on the operator).</i>]
</p><p>12. Finding a cover prior to gathering the information.
<br>Further, review all security measures concerning members of the
<br>Military [Organization] which are covered in prior lessons.
</p><p>[<i>Unclear in the original, this probably means selecting a cover identity
that matches an operational pretext that is plausible for the operation.
Many 'roles' in society give great latitude--student, physician, journalist,
maintenance worker, delivery man, etc.</i>]
</p><p><u>Methods of Gathering Information Using Covert Means</u>: The
<br>Military Organization may obtain secret information using:
<br>A. Surveillance, intelligence, and observation; B. Theft:
<br>C. Interrogation; D. Excitement; E. Drugging; F. Recruitment.
</p><p>[<i>Note that Al-Qaida does not discuss intelligence assets other than
the officer, captives, or human sources--technical, signal, image, etc.
intelligence.</i>]
</p><p>A. <u>Surveillance, Intelligence, and Observation</u>: Civilian and
<br>military targets (personalities). The monitoring may be done on
<br>foot or by car.
</p><p><u>Surveillance on foot</u>:
</p><p>1. The brother or brothers performing the surveillance
<br>operation on foot study the available information
<br>about the target (height,weight, way of walking, looking
<br>at a recent photograph)
</p><p>2. Knowing the target's habits, places he visits, and
<br>communications
</p><p>3. Studying carefully the area where observation will
<br>take place: names of through and dead-end streets,
<br>residents' habits and way of dressing.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-88 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>4. Prior to the start of the surveillance mission, making
<br>sure that all needs related to the mission, especially
<br>money, are met.
</p><p>5. Agreeing on how communications with the leaders will
<br>take place in case the surveillance plan is uncovered
<br>(telephone, a person used for that purpose). The telephone
<br>number should not be written but memorized.
</p><p>6. Agreeing on special signals to exchange orders and
<br>instructions among the surveillance team members.
</p><p>7. Knowing the measures to be taken when the target is
<br>lost, such as contacting the leaders or something else
<br>agreed upon.
</p><p>8. It is not permitted to carry any weapons during the
<br>information-gathering process.
</p><p>9. It is preferable to have a camera with the
<br>surveillance man in case the target is to personally
<br>contact others.
</p><p><u>Surveillance by car</u>:
</p><p>Surveillance by car requires taking certain measures:
</p><p>1. Inspecting the car's fuel, water, and lights.
</p><p>2. The car should be of a common type so it would not
<br>attract people's attention.
</p><p>3. The car should be in good condition and the driver
<br>should be experienced.
</p><p>4. The car plates should not contain real numbers. It is
<br>important to use a false license plate and small numbers
<br>in order to prevent anyone from spotting and memorizing it.
</p><p>5. The car's interior light should be disabled in order
<br>to hide the identity of the surveillance team members
<br>sitting inside.
</p><p>6. The number and appearance of the car surveillance team
<br>members should match those of the target's car.
</p><p>[<i>The methods discussed here would develop an intelligence model of
a potential target based on time, location, and behavior, later to be analyzed
for vulnerabilities the present an opportunity for Al-Qaida. Item foot-1
is interesting for observation of 'way of walking'--a change in this indicator
may show behavioral shifts in the target (awareness of target status),
or may be an element in borrowing the target's identity (from a distance,
different gait is a clear indicator that someone may not be who they appear
to be). Item foot-3 would produce intelligence necessary in establishing
plausible pretexts and cover identities that blend into the context. Item
foot-5 is a 'blown operation' indicator--the target has been alerted or
the operator has been spotted (execution of an evasion and escape plan
would be indicated prior to making such a phone call). Item foot-6 is explicit
regarding a team (good surveillance requires multiple teams); use of coded
communication among the squad is good tradecraft if it blends with the
pretext and cover identities. Item foot-7 is interesting. Solo operators
conducting surveillance will commonly lose the target--loss of the target
is better than exposing the operation, targets should only be modeled in
segments rather than continuously, target patterns aren't known well enough
early in the surveillance process to anticipate behavior, etc. A radical
change in target behavior after a pattern is well-established can be a
problem--it may indicate knowledge of the surveillance, a deliberate shift
in patterns, some other change that may impact on operations, etc. Such
changes are problematic the closer they are to initiation of an operation,
calling into question whether an operation can proceed. Team surveillance
is structured to lose a target--target loss protects the surveillance operation.
Teams pick up at different times, hand off from location to location, operate
near and far to the target, etc. Contacting a leader would be to coordinate
coverage between teams--teams rarely have the perspective of the entire
operation, while a leader can provide that function. The ubiquitous nature
of mobile phones has dramatically simplified the communication task--almost
any cover identity can be expected to use a mobile phone (and new technology,
such as handheld computers with wireless communication, add a whole new
dimension to the surveillance process). Item foot-9 is to model a target's
contact network and gather collateral intelligence on such individuals.
Item car-3 should be explicit--experienced in the local traffic regulations
as well as the surveillance process. Item car-4 presents an operational
risk--surveillance behavior is unusual enough to increase the risk of law
enforcement attention, including checking license plates (a false plate
will lead to immediate scrutiny and put the operation in jeopardy). Item
car-5 implies night surveillance, but doesn't restrict smoking, a common
habit of surveillance personnel that also presents a risk. Item car-6 assumes
that the target fits his/her context, which may not be accurate, and may
not be compatible with the surveillance teams' pretext and cover identities.</i>]

<b>UK/BM-89 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p><u>Performing Surveillance by Car</u>:
</p><p>1. The car being used for surveillance should keep up with the
<br>target’s car during the surveillance operation, especially
<br>in crowded areas and on side streets. The distance between
<br>the two cars depends on the circumstances.
</p><p>[<i>Distance between a target's car and a surveillance team is a trade-off--too
close and the team may betray that surveillance is taking place, too far
away and the team may lose the target. As discussed in comments above,
an experienced team will favor losing a target over 'blowing' the operation.</i>]
</p><p>2. If the target gets out of his car and starts to walk,
<br>one of the surveillance team members should get out and observe
<br>him.
</p><p>[<i>Another error of tradecraft. The reason for multiple teams is that
a second team can exit a vehicle out of sight and approach the location--behavior
consistent with the situation. The risk in this approach is the nature
of the communication with a commander, who then directs the supplemental
team's movements.</i>]
</p><p>3. Follow all aforementioned measures for surveillance on
<br>foot.
</p><p><u>Exercises to detect surveillance by car</u>:
</p><p>1. The surveillance car speeds up then stops suddenly while
<br>observing which other car is affected (this is done where
<br>there is not a lot of traffic).
</p><p>2. The surveillance car enters a dead-end street.
</p><p>3. The surveillance car goes in the opposite direction of
<br>traffic.
</p><p>4. The surveillance car stops and goes backwards.
</p><p>5. [The surveillance car] enters a parking lot and immediately
<br>goes out.
</p><p>6. [The surveillance car] takes a side road and stops.
</p><p>[<i>To generalize, adopt a behavior that requires a response that can
be observed (such as going through a traffic signal indicating stop), or
lure a surveillance team into a situation where they will be obvious in
the context (such as item 2). Note that the response to surveillance, if
discovered, is not specified--combat, escape, bluff, etc. are left to the
discretion of the team.</i>]
</p><p>A. <u>Surveillance, Intelligence,and Observation</u> (Information
<br>about the enemy places)
</p><p>The Organization’s command needs detailed information about
<br>the enemy‘s vital establishments, whether civilian or
<br>military, in order to make safe plans, reach firm
<br>decisions, and avoid surprises. Thus, the individual who
<br>gathers information about a desired location should, in
<br>addition to drawing a diagram, describe it and all its
<br>details.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-90 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p><u>The Drawing</u>: The brother should draw a diagram of the area,
<br>the street, and the location which is the target of the information-
<br>gathering. He should describe its shape and characteristics.
<br>The drawing should be realistic so that someone who never saw
<br>the location could visualize it. It is preferable to also put
<br>on the drawing the directions of traffic, police stations,
<br>and security centers.
</p><p><u>The Description</u>: It is necessary to gather as much information
<br>about the location as possible. For instance:
</p><p>1. Traffic directions and how wide the streets are
</p><p>2. Transportation leading to the location
</p><p>3. The area, appearance, and setting of the place
</p><p>4. Traffic signals and pedestrian areas
</p><p>5. Security personnel centers and government agencies
</p><p>6. Embassies and consulates
</p><p>7. The economic characteristics of the area and traffic
<br>congestion times
</p><p>8. Public parks
</p><p>9. Amount and location of lighting
</p><p>It is preferable to photograph the area as a whole first, then
<br>the street of the [desired] location. If possible, panoramic
<br>pictures should be taken. That is, the collection of views
<br>should be continuous in a such way that all pictures are taken
<br>from one location and that the ending of one picture is the
<br>beginning of the next. The photographer should be experienced
<br>with and proficient in film processing and developing. It is
<br>risky to use an outside film processing service. When observing
<br>a military installation or camp, we discourage taking pictures
<br>where it is forbidden. The brother/photographer should use a

<b>UK/BM-91 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>modern camera that can photograph at night or from a distance,
<br>and only the lens of the camera should be visible. When
<br>gathering information about a military camp, the brother should
<br>draw a diagram of the camp’s overall area, the camp itself, and
<br>its interior, if possible.
</p><p><u>The description of the base or camp</u> must contain the following:
</p><p>1. Location
</p><p>2. Exterior shape
</p><p>3. Transportation to it
</p><p>4. Space [area]
</p><p>5. Weapons used
</p><p>6. Unit using the camp
</p><p>7. Fortifications and tunnels
</p><p>8. Guard posts
</p><p>9. Amount and periods of lighting
</p><p>10. Number of soldiers and officers. Officers’ ranks
</p><p>11. Ammunition depot locations
</p><p>12. Vehicles and automobiles
</p><p>13. Leave policy
</p><p>14. Commander's name, rank, arrival and departure times
</p><p>15. Degree and speed of mobilization
</p><p>16. Brigades and names of companies
</p><p>17. Sleeping and waking times
</p><p>18. Telephone lines and means of communication
</p><p>The brother gathering the information may start a friendship
<br>with one of the soldiers or officers of that base. Information
<br>may be collected gradually and easily from soldiers when giving
<br>them rides from the camp to the bus or train stations, etc.
</p><p>[<i>The source of this section of the document is clearly experienced
at this sort of intelligence operation. Intelligence is clearly valued
"in order to make safe plans, reach firm decisions, and avoid surprises."
Drawing and making the description of sufficient detail to allow operator
visualization is instrumental in mission success--learning 'rote' directions
for an operation pales in comparison an adequate and accurate mental model.
Structural and contextual detail described in this section give operators
a 'fighting chance.' The photographic suggestions are constructive but
incomplete--the area should be photographed as extensively as possible,
various times of day under different lighting conditions, etc. would be
of great help. Photographs from the window of time for the probable attack
would be best--light levels, traffic levels, etc. would be tactically significant.
Photography of military targets is much higher risk, but modern equipment
mitigates such risk considerably. Dependence on film, and thus the risk
associated with film development, are interesting in the context of digital
equipment--while digital equipment is lovely gear, film quality and light/color
responsiveness still make it superior for intelligence purposes. Note in
the 'description of the base or camp' section that internal camp layout
is not explicitly specified--is it assumed, or does Al-Qaida planning include
attacks/devices that are catastrophic? Historically, Al-Qaida attacks have
not been 'surgical,' but on a scale that makes internal layout of facilities
irrelevant. The risk associated with on-going contact with military personnel
is an interesting trade-off (and in contradiction of earlier tradecraft
discussion in the manual)--familiarity and the risk of exposure against
the off-chance of collecting fragments of intelligence value.</i>]
</p><p>B. <u>Gathering Information Through Interrogation</u>: Security
<br>personnel in our countries arrest brothers and obtain the
<br>needed information through interrogation and torture.
</p><p>[<i>If this is not a translation error, the reference to 'security personnel
in our countries' is incredibly indiscrete. Al-Qaida is only concerned
with the U.S. insofar as it relates to their primary purpose--installation
of Islamic regimes (by their interpretation of Islam) in the Middle East,
the area that truly matters to them. Islam itself is not inherently nationalistic
(see Bernard Lewis' excellent analyses regarding this), so this is another
indication that Al-Qaida has slipped off a 'proper' Islamic interpretation.</i>]
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-92 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>The Military Organization must do likewise. On one hand,
<br>the Organization can obtain important information about
<br>enemy establishments and personnel. On the other hand,
<br>that is a form of necessary punishment.
</p><p>Information is collected in this method by kidnaping an
<br>enemy individual, interrogating him, and torturing him.
</p><p>[<i>This, again assuming accurate translation, is further evidence of
Al-Qaida's view that their interpretation of Islam is the correct one,
while others are either jahiliyya or apostate. The view of torture (including,
one presumes, of fellow moslems) as a 'form of necessary punishment' shows
the questionable moral ground infirmly supporting Al-Qaida. A position
of 'the means justify the end' shows a recognition of 'right' and 'wrong'--and
a conscious decision to 'do something wrong' for a greater good. The position
demonstrated in the manual overall, but this in particular, is 'by any
means necessary,' regardless of the exploitation of the Qur'an--a complete
rejection of moral considerations. It's a critical distinction in understanding
Al-Qaida's operations--given certain capabilities, does their intention
and 'profile' lead to use? While great efforts are made at justification
and rationalization, it's clear that Al-Qaida recognizes no limitations
or constraints on behavior, and therefore any operation is possible.</i>]
</p><p>This source of information is not permanent. Also, caution
<br>should be exercised about being deceived by misinformation
<br>from enemy individuals. Thus, the brother who interrogates
<br>the hostage should possess the following characteristics:
</p><p>1. Should have knowledge and expertise about people's
<br>behavior and morals.
</p><p>2. Should have a strong personality.
</p><p>3. Should possess a sixth sense based on practice and
<br>experience.
</p><p>4. Should be extremely patient.
</p><p>5. Should be able to act, pretend, and mask himself.
</p><p>6. Should be intelligent, observant, analytical, and
<br>deductive.
</p><p>7. Should be able to establish an investigative plan.
</p><p>[<i>Methods of torture are described later in the document. Detection
of 'misinformation' provided by a victim is not explicitly explained--the
common method is continuing torture long after story inconsistencies have
ceased to occur. The profile for the operator performing the torture is
detailed; characteristic selected for are experience, maturity, worldliness,
dominant, intuitive, patient, consumate acting abilities, superior intelligence,
and operational/intelligence experience. Managing the torture process as
an experienced operator and intelligence producer/consumer makes the process
more directed at 'useful' data; on-the-fly filtering for what's relevant
and applicable as well as detection of false, confused, or inaccurate recollection
are critical. Torture is a downhill bicycle race--the operator needs to
establish the reality of the situation while hinting at the probable outcome
(crippling physical effects, death). At the same time, the victim is trying
to hold out while listening to an internal sense of self--past a certain
point, death is more desireable than living. At such a point, the operator
and the victim are truly engaged--the victim trying to hold out, forcing
damage that may bring death more quickly, while the operator tries to sustain
the victim while still trying to elicit information. Long-term captivity
leads to a different form of torture--patient, with recovery periods. The
content of the victim's mind, however, is perishable--from the moment that
their organization (and this applies to any side in this miserable game)
discovers the victim is missing, the intelligence value of what they know
decreases. Operations, locations, contact details, codes, caches, cover
identities, etc. are only 'good' for a reasonably short duration. This
imposes the nature of the torture session as a race, the victim trying
to hold out long enough for the value to be negligable, with the operator
trying to get something actionable in time.</i>]

</p><p>C. <u>Gathering Information Through Recruitment</u>: Recruiting
<br>agents is the most dangerous task that an enlisted brother
<br>can perform. Because of this dangerous task, the brother
<br>may be killed or imprisoned. Thus, the recruitment task
<br>must be performed by special types of members.
</p><p>[<i>False flag operations appear to not be considered. A solid profile
of a potential human source, an asset, might indicate a 'low risk' pretext
and cover identity that could be used to establish the relationship. While
any contact, particularly of sensitive assets, entails risk, some approaches
are greater risk than others. Success in the intelligence community for
'coerced' assets has largely come from establishing the relationship in
advance of any attempt to use the asset--the relationship creates leverage
(or the other way around), and 'cushions the shock' that creates the exposure
risk. Compartmentalizing the task of acquiring and running assets is intelligent--it's
a tricky business at best, and needs opeational security beyond regular
'sleeper' cells.</i>]
</p><p>There are a number of motives that might entice an
<br>uncommitted person to take part in intelligence work.
</p><p>These motives are:
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-93 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>1. Coercion and entanglement
</p><p>2. Greed and love for money
</p><p>3. Displaying courage and love of adventure
</p><p>4. Love of amusement and deviance
</p><p>5. Mental and political orientation
</p><p>6. Fear of being harmed
</p><p>The Organization may use motives No. 2, 3, 5, and 6 in
<br>recruitment.
</p><p>[<i>'Coercion and entanglement' are likely rejected because of the nature
of such relationships, commonly sexual, and the fine hand necessary to
play blackmail well. Given the vast majority of Al-Qaida being male, this
would require either homosexual activity or female assets (although Al-Qaida
may use female operators, that appears unlikely by the organizational profile
and the voice of this manual). 'Love of amusement and deviance' would conflict
with the interpretation of Islam essential to Al-Qaida--use of such assets
would require internal compromise on the part of the intelligence officer
running the assets. Note the similarity of the asset profile to what conventional
intelligence agencies approve of--profit, psychology, politics, and pressure
motivations. More 'serious' intelligence agencies will use sexual assets
and 'weirdos,' but not Al-Qaida, nor the U.S.</i>]
</p><p>Candidates for Recruitment Are:
</p><p>1. Smugglers
</p><p>2. Those seeking political asylum
</p><p>3. Adventurers
</p><p>4. Workers at coffee shops, restaurants, and hotels
</p><p>5. People in need
</p><p>6. Employees at borders, airports, and seaports
</p><p>[<i>Smugglers are used to breaking the rules and have useful intelligence--safe
routes, gaps in the systems, contacts that can be bribed, etc. Political
asylum is curious in Al-Qaida's approach--this, in all probability, means
flight from some government or another and the necessity of protection.
Pogroms against moslems and 'militant Islam' drive potential recruits right
into the hands of Al-Qaida. Adventurers flocked to Al-Qaida in large numbers
(even during the bombing in Afghanistan by the U.S., moslems were crossing
the border to fight with Al-Qaida and the Taliban). Workers in coffee shops,
restaurants, and hotels can gather intelligence, assist the organization
in support roles, have ready access to the 'cash economy,' and are largely
'invisible.' People in need can be purchased, and may even have gratitude.
Employees at borders, airports, and seaports control the entry and exit
points to countries, the first line of defense (and in most Westernized
countries, the only line of defense). This last category is the most likely
to be managed through a 'fear of being harmed'--if not directly, then through
threats against family and friends.</i>]
</p><p><u>Types of Agents Preferred by The American Intelligence</u>
<br><u>Agency [CIA]</u>:
</p><p>1. Foreign officials who are disenchanted with their country's
<br>policies and are looking towards the U.S. for guidance and
<br>direction.
</p><p>2. The ideologist (who is in his county but against his
<br>government) is considered a valuable catch and a good
<br>candidate for American Intelligence Agency [CIA].
</p><p>3. Officials who have a lavish lifestyle and cannot keep up
<br>using their regular wages, or those who have weaknesses for
<br>women, other men, or alcoholic beverages. The agent who
<br>can be bought using the aforementioned means is an easy
<br>target, but the agent who considers what he does a noble
<br>cause is difficult to recruit by enemy intelligence.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-94 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>4. For that purpose, students and soldiers in Third World
<br>countries are considered valuable targets. Soldiers are
<br>the dominating and controlling elements of those countries.
</p><p>[<i>U.S. intelligence is far from monolithic; the comment regarding
CIA is typical misassessment of the actual U.S. intelligence process and
community. The asset profile attributed to U.S. intelligence is largely
inadequate, but discussion of the profile is inappropriate. Note the attention
on students and military personnel--student movements are considered a
leverage point (from Iran to China, the U.S. to the U.S.S.R.), and control
of military assets equates to control of the political system. Subversion
of politicians in the U.S. is effective because they have command authority
over military and intelligence forces; this situation is reversed in most
of the countries Al-Qaida is concerned with gaining control over.</i>]
</p><p><u>Recruitment Stages</u>: Suppose the Islamic Organization, with its
<br>modest capabilities, wants to obtain information about an
<br>important target (important personality, building, camp, agency,
<br>ministry). It has to do the following:
</p><p>1. <u>Finding the Agent</u>: In this stage, the Organization picks
<br>the suitable person f o r supplying the information. The
<br>Organization learns about that person: His financial
<br>condition, his family status, his position regarding the
<br>government, and his weaknesses and strengths.
</p><p>2. <u>Evaluating the Agent</u>: In this stage, the agent is placed
<br>under continuous observation to learn the times of his
<br>departure to and return from work, the places he visits,
<br>the individuals he meets, and his social interaction with
<br>those that he meets in coffee shops, clubs, etc.
</p><p>3. <u>Approaching the Agent</u>: After gathering information about
<br>him, a relationship with him is developed under a certain
<br>cover, such as:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Family connection and tribal relations.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Developing a friendship with him in the club, coffee
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; shop, and workers union. The [recruiting] brother
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; develops the friendship as if it were unpretentious
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; and unplanned. The relationship should develop
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; naturally and gradually in order not to attract the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; target’s attention.
</p><p><u>Important Note</u>: In case the first brother fails to develop
<br>a friendship with the target, another brother takes over
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-95 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>after learning from the first about the target’s weaknesses
<br>(motives that can be exploited) such as his love f o r money,
<br>opposition to the government, love for adventure, or
<br>display courage.
</p><p>4. <u>Recruiting the Agent</u>: After finding, evaluating, and
<br>approaching a target, comes the second stage of recruiting
<br>him. Recruiting may be direct, that is, telling the agent
<br>frankly about working for the Organization for a specific
<br>and agreed-upon salary. A promise is secured in writing or
<br>verbally.
</p><p>Or recruitment may be indirect, that is, information may be
<br>taken from the target without informing him that he is an
<br>agent. That may be accomplished by giving him gifts,
<br>sharing his joys and sorrows, and attempting to solve his
<br>problems.
</p><p>5. <u>Testing the Agent</u>: In this stage, the agent is assigned
<br>certain tasks in order to test his ability, loyalty, and
<br>dependability. The agent does not know that the
<br>Organization already has the sought information. If the
<br>information supplied by the agent does not match the
<br>Organization’s existing information, then the agent may be
<br>an unreliable source of information or may be trying to
<br>mislead the Organization. During the testing stage, the
<br>agent should remain under careful observation to spot all
<br>his movements.
</p><p>6. <u>Training the Agent</u>: This stage applies tothe recruited
<br>agent, that is, the agent who has been recruited directly
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-96 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>and is aware that he has been recruited by someone or some
<br>organization for money or other things. That agent: may be
<br>trained on the following:
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Work secrecy and means of gathering and hiding
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; information
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The method of passing information on to officials
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Concealment and disguising
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Interrogation and resisting the interrogation
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Explaining the assigned mission in utmost detail
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Photography
</p><p>There might not be any training at all. The agent may be
<br>given freedom in his work, relying on his instinct,
<br>talents, background, and the capabilities of his superior
<br>brother.
</p><p>7. <u>Treating the Agent</u>: The brother who manages the agent
<br>should possess the qualifications of a perfect spy, a
<br>psychiatrist, and an interrogator. There are two points of
<br>view on treating the agent:
</p><p><u>First Point of View</u>: Maintaining a strong personal
<br>relationship with the agent. This technique provides the
<br>agent with the motivation that entices him to take chances
<br>in order to please his friend with the information.
<br>However, this technique has disadvantages. The barriers
<br>between the agent and his superiors are removed, and the
<br>agent may ask for many things that were not agreed upon.
</p><p><u>Second Point of View</u>: The person managing the agent treats
<br>him roughly and pushes him to the limits for the purpose of
<br>getting as much information as possible. This technique
<br>uses harshness, cruelty, and threats in order to keep the
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-97 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>agent constantly active. I believe that the Islamic
<br>Military organization can combine the two techniques. The
<br>agent may be treated in a careful Islamic manner, while the
<br>managing brother appeals to the agent's conscience and his
<br>Islamic association with the work for majestic Allah's
<br>religion. He lures the agent with money and gifts, and uses
<br>cruelty and kindness when appropriate.
</p><p>8. <u>Terminating the Agent’s Services</u>: That should occur when
<br>any of the following take place: a. The recruitment mission
<br>terminates, b. Incapacity to work because of sickness or
<br>changes in the job situation, c. Repeated errors in
<br>security measures, d. The agent requests the termination.
</p><p><u>Means for Testing the Recruit</u>: 1. Requesting specific
<br>information that the Organization knows well, 2. Monitoring him
<br>while he performs his covert work, 3. Overpaying him in order to
<br>know his trustworthiness, 4. Giving him a chance to tamper with
<br>the work documents (unimportant documents).
</p><p>[<i>HUMINT is an art rather than a science because the assets are unpredictable;
this is a significant reason why countries such as the U.S. have relied
so much on technical means and methods. The asset management process is
informative. Organizational knowledge is reviewed for what is needed, and
a target is identified that may be able to supply the information. The
target is evaluated for suitability and a way to establish a relationship;
the target is also modeled for profiling purposes--psychology is essential.
Recruiting the target as an asset is achieved under a plausible pretext
and cover identity. Blown contact is managed by hand-off to another officer,
who attempts a different approach. Note that no major distinction is drawn
between the asset knowing or not knowing the nature of the recruiting organization--either
not a perceived risk (it may be considered 'filtered out' earlier in the
process), or tradecraft not discussed here. Written promises, proof of
affiliation, could provide leverage later in the relationship, or present
risk, but again no mention of the issue. Testing the agent is structured
as a 'one-off'--not taking into account the complexities of such relationships.
Training, if supplied, concentrates on operation security, communication
security, basic tradecraft, observation skills, and coping with apprehension
(indication that assets are not exfiltrated if in jeopardy, or otherwise
'taken care of'). Recognition of the difficulty in running human assets
is interesting. This is Machiavelli's dilemma--is it better to be loved
or feared? Note the comment in the 'second point of view' regarding "I
believe that the Islamic Military organization can combine the two techniques"--an
opinion, not a judgment, meaning not something well seasoned by considerable
experience. These comments may be added by a less experienced operator.
Note that asset 'termination' leaves the asset in place, with no concerns
about turning, blowback, or decommissioning. The 'means for testing the
recruit' are wishful thinking--ability to monitor the key elements of covert
work imply an asset-in-place (possible, given the comment about 'information
that the Organization knows well'); overpayment is a questionable test
(contact procedures would prohibit actual counting of money during a meeting;
significant sums should be transferred in self-confirming ways (funds transfer));
tampering with documents is again questionable (detection requires an untampered
reference; how would an asset know quite what to tamper with?). Location
of this section and its content would tend to indicate later addition (again,
by less competent personnel).</i>]
</p><p><u>Important Advice About Dealing with Agents</u>:
</p><p>1. Do not send sealed packages to the agent or receive them
<br>from him. These could be booby traps.
</p><p>2. Leaving something for the agent should be done as quickly
<br>as possible. When transporting and giving an item to the
<br>agent at the agreed-upon location, it should not attract
<br>attention and lead to the agent's arrest.
</p><p>3. The financial status of the agent should be controlled so
<br>that the agent does not suddenly show great wealth. A
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-98 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>portion of the payment should be given to him, while the
<br>other should be deposited in his bank account.
</p><p>4. When wishing to recruit an agent, events should occur
<br>naturally. You may agree with a friend that he invite the
<br>person to be recruited for dinner, or something similar.
<br>While that intermediary person is talking with him, he
<br>notices your arrival at your friend’s,greets you, starts
<br>to converse with you, and invites you to sit down with the
<br>person you want to recruit.
</p><p>5. When meeting with the agent, make sure neither you or the
<br>meeting place are being monitored. Do not enter a place to
<br>meet with an agent before he does. There could be a trap
<br>for you.
</p><p>6. If you wait for your agent at the agreed-upon location, you
<br>could be a target for him. Be especially careful if he
<br>goes to the bathroom. Once, in Belgium, an Israeli Mossad
<br>officer met an Arab agent. A few minutes after they sat
<br>down, the Arab agent said that he had to go get something.
<br>When he returned, the Israeli intelligence agent was still
<br>there. The Arab agent then pulled out a pistol and shot
<br>the Mossad agent several times.
</p><p>7. In order to communicate with the agent, it is necessary to
<br>specify locations such as parks, a university campus area,
<br>etc.
</p><p>8. It is necessary to continuously communicate with the agent,
<br>to learn about his problems and requests, help him as much
<br>as possible, lift his morale, and renew his confidence.
</p><p>[<i>Item 1 is good operations security; packages leave a risk of exposure
as well. Item 2 implies lack or infrequent use of dead-drops, a curious
gap in tradecraft (personal contact is, however, more certain). Item 3
is a security measure that is surprisingly necessary (see Aldrich Ames);
in Middle Eastern countries, controls are particularly important, since
most assets would likely undergo a significant behavioral change. Item
4 is good tradecraft--stick to pretexts. Items 5 &amp; 6 are operations
security for the officer running the asset--like wild animals, assets can
never be considered 'safe.' Item 7 is setting the groundrules for contact,
particularly contexts that will fit with the pretext of the officer's cover
identity. Item 8 is 'preventive maintenance'--assets are under intense
and unusual pressure, and a psychological collapse puts operations and
the officer in jeopardy.</i>]

</p><p>From the front:
</p><p>1- The two eyes.
</p><p>2- Where the veins and arteries converge in the neck.
</p><p>3- Top of the stomach, with the end of the stick.
</p><p>4- Above the genitals, with the end of the club.

</p><p>1- Choking (Neck area). There is no other area besides the neck.
</p><p><u>Assassination using Hands</u>:
</p><p>1- Choking.

<br>slowly, but relentlessly.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Extracting Abrin and Ricin</u>
</p><p>In order to facilitate removing the shells of these seeds, soak
<br>3.2 ounces (an ounce = 31.1 milligrams) of castor-oil plant seeds
<br>in about 10 ounces of water, adding two teaspoons of 1yo [sic,
<br>maybe meant lye] or an alkaline (a substance extracted from soap
<br>powder). You need to submerge the seeds in the water, so cover
<br>them with clean gravel or use marble. Let them soak for an hour,
<br>then take out the seeds, clean them, and let the shells dry. They
<br>can be easily removed after that.
</p><p>Put the shelled seeds in a mixture four times their weight of
<br>acetone, until they completely harden, Then put them in a covered
<br>glass container, and leave them for 72 hours. After that,
<br>transfer them to another container through a coffee filter. Put
<br>on surgical gloves and a mask, and squeeze out as much of the
<br>acetone as possible. Then add fresh acetone and repeat

<u>C- The Water Hemlock Plant</u>
</p><p>A lethal dose is 3.2 grams. It has a palatable taste, and is very
<br>similar to another plant, parsnip.
</p><p><u>Symptoms</u>: Nervous spasms within 15 to 60 minutes, including
<br>severe locking and clenching of the jaw to the extent that the
<br>tongue could be cut off.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>D- The Tanj Oil Tree</u>
</p><p><u>Second- Semi-alkaline substances</u>: They are highly solvent in
<br>alcohol.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>A- Tobacco</u>
</p><p>There is enough nicotine in three cigarettes to kill a person.
<br>Sixty to 70 milligrams of pure nicotine will kill a person within
<br>an hour if eaten.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>B- Potato Sprout</u>
</p><p>The potato sprout (both rotten and green) contains Solanine.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>How to Extract Poisonous Alkaline</u> <i>[Alkaloids]</i>
</p><p>Chop up the leaves finely. It is preferable to make a mixture,
<br>and then put it in a drip coffee maker, through which the boiling
<br>water can penetrate the coffee gradually.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-159 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>Fill a metal pot with about 1/3 rubbing (isopropy[l]), alcohol
<br>mixed with Isopropyl. Let it strain and percolate for an hour.
<br>During the first half hour, add alcohol as needed, and during the
<br>second half hour, let it boil until you have two ounces left in
<br>the container. These, [two] ounces or [could be] less are alcohol
<br>mixed with poison alkaline. Put this amount on a plate, and let
<br>the alcohol evaporate. The remainder on the plate will be very
<br>pure poison. There is another method which is not as good, but it
<br>doesn't require the drip coffee maker. It is simply heating the
<br>minced and mixed plants with the alcohol [we had] before over a
<br>low flame. Its symptoms will appear in 160 days.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Poisoning from Eating Spoiled Food</u>
</p><p>Since .000028 grams will kill a person, this poison is absolutely
<br>lethal. After consumption, the symptoms appear in 12 to 36 hours.
<br>They include dizziness, headaches, constipation, difficulty
<br>swallowing and speaking, fluids coming from the nose and mouth,
<br>and lack of muscle coordination. It results in death from
<br>respiratory failure. If it is received in the blood stream, death
<br>is very swift and almost without symptoms.
</p><p><u>How to Prepare Spoiled Food</u>
</p><p>Fill a pot with corn and green beans. Put in a small piece of
<br>meat and about two spoonfuls of fresh excrement. Pour the water
<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>into the pot until there is surface tension at the lip of the
<br>pot. Cover the pot tightly. If you do that correctly, there will
<br>be no air trapped in the pot. Leave the pot in a dark, moderately
<br>warm room for 15 days. At the end of that period, you will notice
<br>a substance on the edge of the pot, and a small amount of
<br>rottenness. These are known bacteria colonies, which secrete
<br>their external poison as a result of the process of bacterial
<br>digestion. You can make three or four pots at the same time
<br>During the time of the destroyer, Jamal Abdul Nasser, someone who

<br>dead.
</p><p>[<i>Ricin first came into public awareness with the assassination of
Georgi Markov during the Cold War; since then, the recipe has been published
in various books (Kurt Saxon), on the Internet, shown up in U.S. militia
training materials, etc. Note that the size and structure of the molecule
is an element in utilization of DMSO (used because it doesn't leave a needlemark
or other point of penetration that would show up in a forensic examination,
although it does leave a signature of its own). Nicotine is another well-discussed
toxin, of interest because of the availability in most circumstances of
cigarettes (prison, Red Cross packages, etc.). The primitive biological
weapon necessitates a weak victim and a lack of modern medical care.</i>]

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleep, food, drink, and medicine.
</p><p>21. Beating on cuts and sore parts of the body.
</p><p>22. Giving the brother a lot of water or very watery

</p><p>9. Controlling everything the brother does, even in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; private, whether he is awake or asleep, to convince him
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; that they are in charge. They would force him to bow
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; his head and look down while talking with the guards.

<br>fabrications of our imagination, or that we copied them from spy
<br>stories. On the contrary, these are factual incidents in the
<br>prisons of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabid, and all other Arab
<br>countries. Those who follow daily events and read the newspapers
<br>and,journals would be amazed to learn that:

</p><p>O young men waging a holy war for the sake of Allah, there is
<br>stil1 hope in you. Your country awaits you, your brothers await
<br>you, your wives wait you, the Muslim hostages await you.

</p><p><u>Advice Taken from the book "Mothakkarat Fida'i Aire</u><sup>8</sup>"
[Memoirs of
<br>a Captured Commando]: Concerning interrogation and questioning,
<br>paraphrased.
</p><p>____________________
</p><p>8 This book is the memoirs of an Iranian Communist. All
<br>brothers should read it.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>1. While being taken to the interrogation and torture areas,
<br>one should concentrate heavily on the route and try to
<br>memorize any signs in order to benefit operations and plan
<br>development.
</p><p>2. In the beginning of the interrogation, a security officer
<br>(interrogator) would come to you with fatherly advice,
<br>deceitful phrases, and "crocodile tears" so you might
<br>confess and tell them everything.
</p><p>3. It is necessary to secretly discard any document related to
<br>the work or anything else considered criminal evidence
<br>against you. Better, do not carry any documents concerning
<br>the work.
</p><p>4. From the first moment in captivity, the brother should
<br>proudly take a firm and opposing position against the enemy
<br>and not obey the orders. The more firm and opposing the
<br>reaction, the more beneficial it is. These reactions will
<br>not 1ead to harsher treatment. Do not give the enemy an
<br>opportunity or an opening.
</p><p>5. During the torture process, pretend that the pain is severe
<br>by bending over and crying loudly.
</p><p>6. As torture intensifies, its end nears.
</p><p>7. Between torture sessions, the officers bargain with
<br>brother and entice him with ending the torture if he
<br>supplies them with any information.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-174 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>8. During the torture session, the counseling preacher may
<br>become a vicious beast.
</p><p>9. The one who gives one piece of information to avoid the
<br>lashes of whips is deluding himself because the torture
<br>would intensify.
</p><p>10. It is necessary that each brother plan for his interrogation
<br>and discuss it with his commander. He may be captured one
<br>day.
</p><p>11. When I talk while under torture, I do not mention unknown
<br>dates and places to the security personnel, but well known
<br>ones.
</p><p>12. When I mention dates or names, it is important to memorize
<br>them because they will ask about them again to know if I was
<br>truthful.
</p><p>13. Pretending to be naive and ignorant during the questioning
<br>may lead to diverging from the plan, because all factors are
<br>against the brother: The place, the people, the situation.
<br>That leads to some or all the outcomes desired by the enemy.
<br>That is, it is important to remain psychologically and
<br>mentally calm and to maintain alertness and foresight.
</p><p>14. Detailing events during the questioning, whether verbally or
<br>in writing, directly increases the crime. That person's
<br>situation is just like someone who falls in a swamp [quick
<br>sand]: the more he tries to save himself, the deeper he
<br>sinks.
</p><p>15. The less information supplied during the torture, the
<br>lighter the judgement will be.
</p><p>16. A devastating mistake that results in harsh judgement is
<br>that of a brother revealing information to others in his
<br>cell
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>UK/BM-175 TRANSLATION</b>
</p><p>not revealed during the torture. This is especially true when
<br>the interrogation is still going on, his fate has&nbsp; been
<br>determined, and the case has not been closed.
</p><p>17. Relating experiences should not take place prior to the
<br>judgement, but after it.
</p><p>18. The interrogators may resort to planting suspicion and
<br>mistrust among the brothers. They may pretend that they
<br>have a friendly relationship with one of the brothers. It
<br>is necessary to think well of one another.
</p><p>19. Do not accept humiliation and disgrace. Disobey orders and
<br>oppose them.
</p><p>20. It is immortant to coordinate with your brothers before
<br>executing any operation (security plan).
</p><p>21. The security personnel may leave you for long periods of
<br>time without asking you any questions in order to break your
<br>will and determination.
</p><p>22. During the interrogation, say only the things that you
<br>agreed upon with your commander. Do not be concerned about
<br>other brothers.
</p><p>[<i>The 'advice' is fairly standard: learn what you can that may assist
in escape, interrogation is largely a psychological game (even if physical
torture is involved), the less information the 'enemy' has in advance the
easier it will be to deceive them, weakness is a 'slippery slope' (contrast
this with the U.S. experience, notably from prisoners of war in Vietnam),
pain is part of the game (with both sides trying to tell reality from perception),
'hard and soft' (good cop and bad cop, someone going rough and someone
being nice) remains a significant element of interrogation, stick to the
deception plan, remember the 'rule of the hole' (first rule of the hole:
when you realize you're in one, stop digging), trust no one (particularly
'fellow prisoners'), don't cooperate, isolation is part of the game, and
hold out as long as possible. Some of this is pure garbage with modern
techniques (item 6 is particularly absurd).</i>]

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PRISONS AND DETENTION CENTERS
</p><p>IF AN INDICTMENT IS ISSUED AND THE TRIAL, BEGINS, THE BROTHER
<br>HAS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING:
</p><p>1. At the beginning of the trial, once more the brothers must
<br>insist on proving that torture was inflicted on them by State
<br>Security [investigators] before the judge.
</p><p>2. Complain [to the court] of mistreatment while in prison.
</p><p>3. Make arrangements for the brother’s defense with the attorney,
<br>whether he was retained by the brother’s family or court-appointed.
</p><p>4. The brother has to do his best to know the names of the state
<br>security officers, who participated in his torture and mention
<br>their names to the judge. [These names may be obtained from
<br>brothers who had to deal with those officers in previous cases.]
</p><p>5. Some brothers may tell and may be lured by the state security
<br>investigators to testify against the brothers [i.e. affirmation
<br>witness], either by not keeping them together in the same prison
<br>during the trials, or by letting them talk to the media. In this
<br>case,they have to be treated gently, and should be offered good
<br>advice, good treatment, and pray that God may guide them.
</p><p>6. During the trial, the court has to be notified of any
<br>mistreatment of the brothers inside the prison.
</p><p>7. It is possible to resort to a hunger strike, but it is a tactic
<br>that can either succeed or fail.
</p><p>8. Take advantage of visits to communicate with brothers outside
<br>prison and exchange information that may be helpful to them in
<br>their work outside prison [according to what occurred during the
<br>investigations]. The importance of mastering the art of hiding
<br>messages is self evident here.
</p><p>- When the brothers are transported from and to the prison [on
<br>their way to the court] they should shout Islamic slogans out
<br>loud from inside the prison cars to impress upon the people
<br>and their family the need to support Islam.
</p><p>- Inside the prison, the brother should not accept any work that
<br>may belittle or demean him or his brothers, such as the cleaning
<br>of the prison bathrooms or hallways.
</p><p>- The brothers should create an Islamic program for themselves
<br>inside the prison, as well as recreational and educational ones,
<br>etc.
</p><p>- The brother in prison should be a role model in selflessness.
<br>Brothers should also pay attention to each others needs and should
<br>help each other and unite vis a vis the prison officers.
</p><p>- The brothers must take advantage of their presence in prison for
<br>obeying and worshiping [God] and memorizing the Qora’an, etc. This
<br>is in addition to all guidelines and procedures that were contained
<br>in the lesson on interrogation and investigation. Lastly, each of
<br>us has to understand that we don’t achieve victory against our
<br>enemies through these actions and security procedures. Rather,
<br>victory is achieved by obeying Almighty and Glorious God and
<br>because of their many sins. Every brother has to be careful so as
<br>not to commit sins and everyone of us has to do his best in obeying
<br>Almighty God, Who said in his Holy Book: “We will, without doubt,
<br>help Our messengers and those who believe (both) in this world’s
<br>life and the one Day when the Witnesses will stand forth.”
</p><p>May God guide us.
</p><p>[<i>Note the assumption of 'due process' and Western judicial procedures.
Items 1, 2, 4, and 6 are intended to derail legal proceedings or obtain
improved circumstances in incarceration. Item 3 means launching a defense--generally
a justification of operations while simultaneously questioning the authority
of the court. Item 7 recognizes that hunger strikes only attract attention
when the prisoner has some sort of moral position or moral authority (and
why a successful hunger strike is the exception rather than the rule).
Item 8 is particularly useful--operationally significant information (particularly
from commanders) may still be relayed, but again in code. Coding mechanisms
are obviously well-considered by Al-Qaida. Note the unnumbered bullets
(likely additions) are oriented at Islamification of the issue, including
building up potential support and recruits inside the prison system. The
quote is the Qur'an 40:51, the Yusufali translation except for the curious
change in wording. The original: "We will, without doubt, help our messengers
and those who believe, (both) in this world's life and on the Day when
the Witnesses will stand forth," which also continues "The Day when no
profit will it be to Wrong-doers to present their excuses, but they will
(only) have the Curse and the Home of Misery."</i>]
</p><p>[Dedication)
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>To this pure Muslim youth, the believer, the mujahid (fighter) for
<br>God’s sake. I present this modest effort as a contribution from me
<br>to pave the way that will lead to Almighty God and to establish a
<br>caliphate along the lines of the prophet.
</p><p>The prophet, peace be upon him, said according to what was related
<br>by Imam Ahmed: “Let the prophecy that God wants be in you, yet God
<br>may remove it if He so wills, and then there will be a Caliphate
<br>according to the prophet’s path [instruction], if God so wills it.
<br>He will also remove that [the Caliphate] if He so wills, and you
<br>will have a disobedient king if God so wills it. Once again, if
<br>God so wills, He will remove him [the disobedient king], and you
<br>will have an oppressive lung. [Finally], if God so wills, He will
<br>remove him [the oppressive king], and you will have a Caliphate
<br>according to the prophet’s path [instruction]. He then became
<br>silent.”
</p><p>[<i>This refers to Ahmed bin Muhammad Hanbal (ibn Hanbal) again, one
of those vigorously supported in the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam.</i>]
</p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF TEAM WORK:
</p><p>1. Team work is the only translation of God’s command, as well as
<br>that of the prophet, to unite and not to disunite. Almighty God
<br>says, “And hold fast, all together, by the Rope which Allah
<br>(stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves.”
<br>In “Sahih Muslim,” it was reported by Abu Horairah, may Allah
<br>look kindly upon him, that the prophet, may Allah’s peace and
<br>greetings be upon him, said: “Allah approves three [things] for
<br>you and disapproves three [things]: He approves that you worship
<br>him, that you do not disbelieve in Him, and that you hold fast,
<br>all together, by the Rope which Allah, and be not divided among
<br>yourselves. He disapproves of three: gossip, asking too much
<br>[for help], and squandering money.”
</p><p>[<i>The first quote is Qur'an 3:103: "And hold fast, all together, by
the rope which Allah (stretches out for you), and be not divided among
yourselves; and remember with gratitude Allah's favour on you; for ye were
enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His Grace, ye became
brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you
from it. Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you: That ye may be guided."
The Sahih Muslim quote is from 18:4255 (the Book Pertaining to Judicial
Decisions) which reads: "Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace
be upon him) as saying: Verily Allah likes three things for you and He
disapproves three things for you. He is pleased with you that you worship
Him and associate nor anything with Him, that you hold fast the rope of
Allah, and be not scattered; and He disapproves for you irrelevant talk,
persistent questioning and the wasting of wealth."</i>]
</p><p>2. Abandoning “team work” for individual and haphazard work means
<br>disobeying that orders of God and the prophet and falling victim
<br>to disunity.
</p><p>3. Team work is conducive to cooperation in righteousness and piety.
</p><p>4. Upholding religion, which God has ordered us by His saying,
<br>“Uphold religion,” will necessarily require an all out confrontation
<br>against all our enemies, who want to recreate darkness. In addition,
<br>it is imperative to stand against darkness in all arenas: the media,
<br>education, [religious] guidance, and counseling, as well as others.
<br>This will make it necessary for us to move on numerous fields so as
<br>to enable the Islamic movement to confront ignorance and achieve
<br>victory against it in the battle to uphold religion. All these vital
<br>goals can not be adequately achieved without organized team work.
<br>Therefore, team work becomes a necessity, in accordance with the
<br>fundamental rule, “Duty cannot be accomplished without it, and it
<br>is a requirement.” This way, team work is achieved through
<br>mustering and organizing the ranks, while putting the Amir (the
<br>Prince) before them, and the right man in the right place, making
<br>plans for action, organizing work, and obtaining facets of
<br>power......
</p><p>[<i>"Together we stand, divided we fall." Curious that obtaining power
is of such importance to the pious.</i>]
